I'd consider upgrading if possible, but it's not necessary.\", \"Excellent value processor which is still more than capable in 1080 gaming and everyday tasks.

It is an entry level processor, but performs well in benchmarks and can give older quad core i5s and i7s a tough challenge, or even outright beat them. It achieved a great score in Cinebench R23, with multi-core performance at 8138 points, and single core performance at 1586 points.\\nWith that being said, it is still an entry level processor, only having 4c/8t comparing to other budget options such as the Ryzen 5 5500 (Having 6c/12t), Ryzen 5 5600G(6c/12t) and the i5-12400f (6c/12t). Still have stellar gaming performance, but there are other options avaliable. Price to performance is amazing.\", \"For the price, the i3 12100F is incredible value. I bought it at $95 but it can drop to $85, which is even better. Strongly recommend for those that want to put together a system on a tight budget, especially over the 13100F and 14100F, since the performance uplift isn't notable, yet they cost much more.\\nKeep in mind that I bought this CPU in March/April before the news with Intel's 13th and 14th gen chips being unstable on higher end SKUs. I can't say I recommend buying into LGA 1700 anymore, but please do your research.\\nAlso, make sure to get a CPU contact frame to prevent motherboard warping!

Even in CPU-heavy games such as modded Minecraft and modded Cities: Skylines, it still performs much better than the i5-2400 that was originally in here, and it performs just as good as my other build with a Ryzen 5 3600.\", \"We opted for the i3-13100F because of it's price/performance ratio and budget considerations. The PC is used mostly for my son's gaming (Fortnite, Valorant) and basic video editing. We figured that if our old i7-930 could barely handle these tasks, this one would boost the performance greatly. Which, after a few hours of use, it turned out to be the case.

But its a great starting off point for LGA1700 (and you'll have a ton of upgrade options) Keep any eye on pricing though, and only get this over the 12100f if they are within a few bucks of each other. (you'll only see a max of about 5% gaming performance between a 12100f and 13100f)\", \"Absolute beast of a CPU. Do not be fooled by its 4 cores or its I3 branding. This thing performs amazing. With turbos up to 4.4GHz, this thing shreds at every workload you throw at it. It's great for day to day use, 1080p gaming, and light productivity. It also doesn't get that hot or loud, so the stock cooler is perfectly adequate. This, plus the overclocked 5600xt, can easily drive my 144hz monitor. Do not underestimate this CPU, especially for its $150 price tag. Its great for budget builds, will be recommending to many others. Definitely a 5 star product.\"]",

This is the beast that was unleashed at Intel. Editing on this CPU (My main usecase) Is as smooth as butter,\\nthe only problem with this chip is, it gets TOASTY, im using a Corsair AIO with this CPU and she reaches temps up to 85°c (Video Editing/Rendering). I had to adjust my fan curves, because running Geekbench, temps got up to 100°c, after adjusting the temps ive seen got to a max of 85°c, and havent seen it go above that,\\nWhen it comes to Gaming, even using GTA V Ultra realism mods, it doesnt get above 75°c\\noverall, beast of a chip, but you NEED a water cooler, eather Custom loop or AIO.\", \"Expensive especially considering there’s the Ryzen 7 7800X3D which beats the i9-13900K on all fronts for gaming. It also gets extremely hot and this and pretty much all i9 chips require liquid cooling. Although for a workstation this CPU is great, it’s strong and capable. So overall if you want a strong workstation CPU— then this is a good purchase. But if you are mostly gaming I would get something like the $400 Ryzen 7 7800X3D.\", \"Good CPU Beating AMD on all benchmarks even threadrippers\", \"I was kinda concerned about the well-known overheating, but actually, the processor performs admirably and runs below 50°C during my tasks. Will do the undervolting soon.\", \"There's a reason why most top-level PC builds use some variety of this. It's one of the best currently available and it's priced as such. The thing is, however, that this chip and it's other varieties (the K, KS, and non-K) are absolutely overkill for 4k gaming. However, people say it's the best so it's what everyone picks. Myself included.\\nSo far, it easily handles everything I throw at it and I have no doubt it'll work well for many years to come. Just make sure to get a good cooling system as this thing runs hot. I use a Noctura NHD-15 and that has worked quite well so far.\\nOctober 1st, 2024 Update: So a lot has happened with 13th/14th gen intel processors since I wrote this review and wow... just wow. So I suppose I've been lucky isofar as my own chip has had zero instability issues, backed up by repeated benchmarking, stress, and diagnostic tests from Intel's diagnostic tool, AIDA64 Extreme, and Cinebench.\\nI don't currently know if this is because I've been running the chip in its default settings or if I just have a good chip. I was never activated it's \\\"gaming mode\\\" through BIOS to fully unlock it due to heat throttling (I have an air-cooled setup). So I'm not 100% certain if I just have a good chip or if it was just saved because I haven't been overclocking it at all.\\nI plan to upgrade to a full custom water-cooled loop, so if that ever comes to fruition, I may or may not yet discover if my chip develops any of these issues. If that happens, I'll likely just get a 12900KS. As things stand, my chip is has zero issues so far so I don't need to change my review.\", \"Not much to say. High end (at least for now) gaming chip.\", \"Great cinebench r23 result, if you can wait until high end AMD Threadripper chips become more affordable it is worth waiting, if you cannot this is a great alternative for at least the next 5 years.\", \"It's the best out there\"]",
