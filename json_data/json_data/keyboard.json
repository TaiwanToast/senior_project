      "Great looking RGB and key stabilizers for $50CAD. Audio control buttons are nice to have. Doesn’t sound terrible either and decent build quality with extendable back legs.",
      "RGB keys look ugly. And it's weird for ME to type",
      "Really all I needed. Looks really cool and haven't had any issues with it. If you aren't looking for anything crazy or special, just get this keyboard and call it a day.",
      "I love the three buttons at the top, but sad there's no programmable RGB (there's a few set buttons that change your RGB, but you have no choice on your own.) Love the button that locks the windows-key so you can't press it. Has saved my *** multiple times now. Would probably upgrade to a mechanical keyboard after this, as the keys are quite high and my hands are not that big, meaning that I have to really reach and press down to press the keys, which causes discomfort in my wrists. Also a bit of input delay, regrettably, which affects me probably the most.",
      "Feels great while gaming and typing. Some keys are clickier than others. You don't need a hundred dollar keyboard, just get this. RGB options look great even though they're limited.",
      "Good keyboard works great. RGB options are limited.",
      "Good for gaming and typing. It performs well and the RGB looks good.",
      "Really nice keyboard. I didn't want anything mechanical, so this works well. Pretty quiet and has a lot of room. The media control and RGB selections are nice",
      "Cheap keyboard ended up surpassing my expectations but the media controls are awesome. RGB is so-so. Kinda wanna see what mechanical feels like tho",
      "Haven’t decided on which mechanical keyboard to get so I picked this up as a back up and really like it so far. Works great."

      "Fits my needs, although I kind of wish it was a bit smaller.",
      "Great value for the money, my only gripe is that for some of the reactive rgb modes, when typing the processor can seemingly get overwhelmed and stop displaying new inputs briefly, still a beautiful and satisfying keyboard.",
      "Pleasantly surprised about Redragon products, very nice and cheap mechanical keyboard and has a great click with red switches. Can't say much for the long term use as I only started with it but I don't see a point overpaying for branded mechanical keyboards if you can get this for €35 on Aliexpress.\nWell done Redragon!",
      "I have the white version and it's a good value keyboard.",
      "Has an awful springy sound after every keypress. But it works, and is very loud and clicky.",
      "The keyboard itself is good, great responsiveness and looks nice.\nThere are 2 reasons why I’m giving it 3 stars and this is more based on my personal experience.\nIt is very loud, so using it at night when my flatmates are sleeping and when I lived with my parents was a disturbance.\n2 It’s ten-keyless, now this wasn’t an issue when I first purchased it but now I find that having a NUMPAD would be beneficial considering the games that I play.\nNothing to take away from the keyboard though, you get what you pay for.",
      "I got this Keyboard off of amazon for dirt cheap a few years ago. Why did I get blue switches you ask? Because I hate myself of course. My two problems for this keyboard. 1 - There's no software to control the RGB. 2 - Whenever you press a key theres this sort of metallic springy sound. It's nothing bad and it's pretty faint, but it's still there. I'm pretty sure this keyboard has a metal backplate, so it's probably that.",
      "I personally used this keyboard for around 3 years (from 2016 to 2019) and the general consensus I can give is that it is a REALLY good, albeit loud, gaming keyboard. The only flaw I can really see in it is that it's tenkey-less, but for both me and the cousin this keyboard went to, that usually isn't a problem. It's now been serving him for almost the same amount of time that I used it (~2 years for him so far, as of October 20, 2022,) and it seems that the decision to give it to him was very much worth it. 5 stars!",
      "This is my old keyboard. Converted me to mechanical.",
      "great bang for the buck. rgb is wonderful but no audio control means i had to bind it to the side mouse buttons"

      "Purchased this to go with my Gamepad Razer Mercury theme.",
      "sounds nice, good",
      "Good keyboard if u like loud clicky keyboard, dont really notice how loud it is until ur friends hear it in the mic. If thats not ur style there is a less clicky version. Don't download synalse for the love of God. It always is running in the background and opens every start. Sometimes I have to unplug the keyboard so my taskbar will load in. The actual keyboard itself is really good just some software issues",
      "Amazing keyboard. Lights are great along with build quality. the cable coming off the back of the keyboard is done beautifully as well.",
      "The keyboard is great but I've been noticing that the keys or the switches (idk) are kinda sticking. Like when I move to the right then I lift my finger and I'm still moving to the right.",
      "This keyboard is a 10/10. If you want a small clean looking, beautiful-sounding keyboard, buy the Huntsman Mini 1000%. The RGB flow looks super clean with the mercury color, I was thinking on getting the black one to keep my setup neutral, but I do not regret buying the white one, it really makes things stick out."

      "Went from a K55 to this keyboard and while I kinda miss the macros on the K55, the Cherry MX Red switches are no joke, it leads to some fast typing and fast response time for gaming.",
      "My (hopefully) endgame keyboard. The Speed Silver switches' actuation are very light, requiring almost a thought to activate, which I very much enjoy for gaming. Typing takes a little getting used to, some mistakes may be made, but overall worth it.",
      "It's a good keyboard so far, about three and a half months old, no issues and I could use a rainbow wave prest that looks nice and I don't have to use iCue.",
      "I really like this keyboard, the buttons are nice to use and there are a few features I love. Having media keys and a swivel volume rocker is pretty convinient and being able to simply unplug the type-c connector and move it out the way for more space to do other work is extremely handy. It surprised me that the key switches don't have much protection against accidental spills, and so my soul left my body when I spilled coffee on it. However, I was able to unplug it instantly and let dry for a while before cleaning it and now using it again as if nothing happened. I'll never have a keyboard without an easily removable cable ever again, its a staple feature!",
      "pricey but very solid keyboard.",
      "Clickity clackity.",
      "I am most conflicted about this keyboard out of the parts of my built. on one hand it is very well built. the RGB looks nice, the media controls are cool, and it feels nice, and the double-shot PBT kecaps feel very nice, on the other hand however, i dont think i am the biggest fan of the linear switches, inb gaming they are quite nice and fine, but in typing i really dont like them, the easyness to push down combined with the wobblieness of the keysaps causes me to click another button by accident constantly, i have had to go back and delete so many times while writing this, i would not be suprised if the backspace key is the first to go, it will probably be better as i get more used to it, but it is still annoying, and this goes without mentioning the noise, there is a very loud and noticable metallic twang noise., that seems to have only gotten louder with time, overall for a first mechanical keyboard it is not bad. but i will propably get something rather differet next time.",
      "I wish this had a wireless option, but it's a great keyboard. Nice and heavy construction, and they use Cherry switches.",
      "I upgraded from a Red Dragon keyboard and mouse combo that I bought off of Amazon which served me well for the last few years. I decided with my new gaming rig that I would purchase higher quality and boy does this keyboard not disappoint.\nPROS: First thing I notice is that it is very sturdy and a bit heavy compared to what I am used to. The keys themselves when typing have a nice crisp click and the RGB effects from the Corsair software add a nice touch to the set up. When used for gaming, if feels great. I do also like the volume scroller which makes it easier for me to control the volume when in games.\nCONS: I will say that this is probably the only downside to the keyboard is the clicking when typing, but this does not bother me at all. It also is a bit costly for those on a budget.\nOVERALL: This is a high quality build, though expensive I would say you are getting what you pay for. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quality product with RGB.",
      "The Corsair K70 is a pretty good keyboard. It feels nice, especially with the PBT keycaps. I will say that the noise generated from typing on it is not as nice. The overall sound is okay, but there is a hollow metallic twang that you can barely hear when typing, and its a bit irritating. When gaming or actively working its not very noticeable, especially with headphones on, but I wouldn’t type an essay on it thats for sure. In hindsight, I would have probably gotten a nice Keychron mechanical keyboard, possibly a Q6. I hate to say it but I do like iCue, its grown on me and I like all the easily programmable features included, especially the macros."

      "Very nice and clicky",
      "This was my first gaming keyboard from a major brand. I have had gaming keyboards in the past, but they were all from knockoff brands. It is also my first 75% TKL keyboard. For what it is, it's expensive, but the build quality is really good and it's also insanely quiet. The 75% TKL design is also perfect for my needs as I don't need any of that numberpad BS. I originally got it for my laptop to use as an external keyboard, but honestly after seeing how good the build quality is, I'm actually going to use it in my main setup. I used it to write this review and honestly it also feels really nice to type on. However the keys feel a bit spongy so I might switch back to my mechanical keyboard, but I wanted to try it out first.",
      "First gaming keyboard. Not mechanical or per rgb, but has a good feel and is quiet enough.",
      "Feels amazing.",
      "Very nice RGB keyboard. The keys are nice and quiet compared to other models and brands which is what I was looking for. Was bought on offer as I think £50 for it is a bit steep. No complaint about it from me.",
      "Pretty decent budget keyboard. I needed the TKL size as some of the programs/games I use have controls on the side. Rgb customization is there for those who need it, I just have it set to one color. Yes, the keyboard is not mechanical, but being my first gaming keyboard, it's OK. The keys feel a little soft when pressing, so perhaps later down the line I will look into a proper mechanical keyboard. But for now, gaming and typing is fairly comfortable.",
      "Gets the job done for now, very quiet.",
      "Good cheap keyboard, really silent and reactive"

I love all of the added features that are provided to you through the GHub software as well, and given that I have quite a few Logitech parts on hand, I decided to compliment them with a keyboard.",

      "Love it, you can change the switches, but for me blue clicky (which are the ones included) are nice.\nused to have a 10 key design but prefer TKL for all that extra mouse real estate."

      "It's decent, I like the flashy colors. Some of the keys are temperamental due to high rate of use, dropping out when typing or moving around in a game, which might be more manageable if I knew how to maintain a keyboard...also it has hot swappable Outemu red switches, and these are the first mechanical key switches I've had. I think in the future I'm going to want to get browns, because the smooth travel makes it really vague, and really easy to press or hold down a key I don't want to be holding down just because my finger is resting on it. If that happens I want some tactile response.",
      "Stabilizers are terrible, switches sound pretty good though. RGB is also pretty good and even throughout the board.",
      "This keyboard is ok, but I would avoid getting it. I've had it for a few months now and already some keys will intermittently stop working for periods from 5 minutes to a couple of days. I would actually recommend getting the GK61, but it is a 60% keyboard while this is full sized.",
      "Loads of RGB patterns and options on this keyboard and it’s also a mechanical as well. Lots of value for the price.",
      "I love this keyboard. Has Outemu Red switches (just a much cheaper version of Cherry reds honestly you can do your own switch research) and the RGB even left at standard is pretty slick. I wanted to have the 10key (I still use it at least) and wired so this was the right choice for me.",
      "I honestly love this keyboard. Looks really clean and has good weight. Lights behind the keys look good and have a lot of options for different patterns and modes. The keys are pretty loud and clicky which some people may find annoying but I personally like the sound they make. Coming from a laptop, it took me a little while to get used to the size and shape of the keys but overall not a big deal. Great keyboard for only $40",
      "I really like this keyboard. It is on the quieter side for a relatively inexpensive mechanical, but I do wish it was just a tad quieter.\nAfter a few months of use, on of my switches started flaking out. Customer service helped me figure out how to use the included tools and an included extra switch to fix it. Great service!",
      "It's cheap, it's mechanical, it's per key rgb. Only gave it 4 stars because it's a bit difficult to find the RGB software for the keyboard on the website but other than that it's great.",
      "Vibrant, quiet, durable. Great budget mechanical!",
      "Very epic「GAMING」keyboard. Full RGB, clicky mechanical keys (like cherry mx red, but they are not cherries), lots of on-board customization too, so you don't need to use the app it has online (which I don't think you should, since it probably is riddled with viruses, so I recommend you don't use it, but you could try if you like). Lots of media keys (not dedicated, they are tied to function keys). All of that under $50! It's good, I recommend it."

A little annoying to keep clean, with the keys being so open and all, and a key or two gets a tiny bit stuck-ish with long use, but overall, I actually surprisingly like this keyboard, would never think of getting a mechanical one if I could just get a higher end, easier to keep tidy one like this."

      "A common membrane keyboard which at first feels strange but a good strange haha, the illumination is quite nice and shines bright enough to distinguish each key, if it had illumination on the multimedia buttons I would give it 5 stars.",
      "for this price you could get a better mechanical keyboard.",
      "chose it because it was the cheapest and im not disappointed. my favorite part is the volume and play/pause/skip buttons on the top right. the only downside is the individual keys arent lit up but it doesnt affect me, especially because of the price",
      "A good keyboard that gets its job done with flying colors.",
      "Exactly what I was looking for. If you hate mechanical keyboards as much as I do, this keyboard will probably be perfect for you. I find \"media keys\" (pause, play, next,... + volume keys) especially useful. Other shortcuts available if you need them. Work with iCUE, so great if you own other Corsair products. If you care about RGB though, you'd probably want to give 10 bucks more to get the XT version. The difference? Each keys on the XT version has its own light, while on this version, RGB is made in areas. It clearly looks less good than the XT, but I personally don't really care about RGB.",
      "RGB Keyboard. One caveat is that the lights stay on after you shut down your computer. I would be fine if it was one color but it flickers all sorts of colors",
      "Good RGB and the keys feel good, but definitely not the highest quality since it's a membrane keyboard. Wrist rest is good but wish the keyboard was a bit shorter and the wrist rest provided a bit more support. Overall a good purchase. Plus it sounds nice too!",
      "good membrane keyboard, could've had the PRO XT one for 5 euro more but i didn't know of its existance before i ordered it.\nits good to know it's resistant to dust and water but i think those technologies are also incorporated into the higher-end keyboards that corsair makes, they just dont market them there because they are high-end."

      "This keyboard far exceeded my expectations. I got it for the adjustable actuation points and was greeted with a very user friendly software, hotkey setups, and a newer feature of rapid speed and rapid tap keys (which are just fancy gamer things I'd recommend just looking up).",
      "Satisfying sound and satisfying feel!",

      "Amazing quiet keyboard, love the wrist rest, THE SOFTWARE IS CRAZY.",
      "My favorite keyboard.",
      "This is an overkill featured keyboard. I love it!",
      "The omnipoint switches and OLED display are overrated gimmicks but the per key RGB and all round \"keyboardness\" is excellent. also USB pass through is such an underrated feature. I can plug my mouse for 0 latency gaming/charging or charge my headphones while at my desk, and the wire I use came with the mouse (its very lightweight) so sometimes I forget my headphones are plugged into my keyboard and get jerked back lol (not too violently and not enough to break anything).",
      "My favorite keyboard to date. Each key can be customized to activate at a certain depth. You can customize RGB infinitely. I have a few profiles set up for productivity, and others for gaming. Pretty slick. It better be, look at the price!",
      "I chose this keyboard because of the screen, the linear keys and the fully adjustable RGB. I wish it had slightly more for media controls, but I get that they wanted it to look as sleek as possible. The linear keys are somewhat disappointing as they are just as loud as mechanical switches as far as I can tell. They do feel really smooth though and I have to say that typing this is very enjoyable despite the noise. I like the feel of the wrist rest as well and the magnetic attachment is a really nice touch. There is also a nice LED outline around the passthrough USB port which I can't see unless I lean forward to look for it which is absolutely brilliant design. Speaking of the USB passthrough though, the wire for this keyboard is HUGE. It's my first passthrough keyboard to idk if maybe they all have wires this large, but honestly it seem excessive to me. The LED screen is a nice touch and was the main selling point to me. I didn't want the hassle of incorporating a screen into my tower, and this is a super convenient work around. The Steelseries Engine software is fairly easy to use even if it tries to sell me things sometimes which is annoying. I have the screen set to cycle between displaying GPU load & clock, CPU load & clock, and CPU & GPU temps on three different pages.\nTL;DR Despite my slight complaints about what I wanted out of this keyboard, it really is a quality product and I do recommend it.",
      "If I could get this exact keyboard in a wireless model, I would be in heaven! Everything about this board is amazing. They keypresses are smooth and quiet, with zero noise actuation: the only real music this makes while typing are the keys themselves \"bottoming-out\" like any keyboard will do. I love the widely customizable RGB options, too!"

      "Very responsive keyboard. The Optical switches feel a bit weird initially, but I did get used to it quickly. The lack of Linux support for RGB control (or at least, as far as I know) is a bit annoying",
      "Needed a new Corsair keyboard because the last one's LEDs were turning yellow.\nStill wanted a USB passthrough, and the additional macro keys are a nice touch.",
      "Icue software is trash and doesn't work half the time, but keyboard is mid overall and sounds just as mid honestly is Corsair enough said...",
      "The key presses register quick and the actuation point is basically zero. You touch it it goes. I haven't found much use of the iCUE wheel YET. It looks absolutely gorgeous as well.",
      "The keyboard is very clickety clackity (that's a plus for me), and super easy to type on. My only gripe is my fingers are heavy and that when they rest on the keys I can inadvertently press a key. This is noticeable when playing League where I can sometimes press Q by mistake. While this is not an issue indicative of poor manufacture, I warrant it a personal issue of enough annoyance to give it 4 stars. Smaller hands will probably not have this issue. I'm a chef and wear size extra large disposable gloves in the kitchen, if this helps someone make the decision to buy it or not.",
      "Great KB.",
      "Really nice keyboard. The wristwrest is really comfortable, the rgb looks amazing, it feels nice to type on and game on. The wheel is surprisingly useful and so are the media keys. The only con is the ICUE software which can be *** at times.",
      "Great feel on key press.",
      "Very pricey but you notice the extra quality.",
      "The font is a little sci-fi and I haven't found much use for the control wheel but lots of options for lighting and the keys feel great."

      "This is an excellent keyboard. Despite its wireless capabilities, I always just use it wired, but it's nice to be able to unplug it if I want to. I have the clicky version, and I enjoy typing on it. I don't know how much others enjoy hearing me type on it, though. Having a numpad is a must for me personally, so I appreciate that this is a full size keyboard. The macro buttons are also nice, though I have limited uses for them other than creating a hotkey for Game Bar screenshots.",
      "Feels nice, makes a click sound I like, but not annoyingly loud",
      "Pros: Slim, easy to keep clean, simple RGB settings, and performs well.\nCons: None.",
      "Has configurable G-keys with 3 configs you can switch between on the keyboard itself, also a key for disabling a key temporarily if you have any troubles, which really comes in handy. Nice lighting, and has different brightnesses. The wireless connection is very bad, however, so I use the cable included, and the keys easily fade away showing just the light from beneath, didn't last a single month. But it was only the S and D key for me due to sliding over them a lot when gaming.",
      "I love it, i was previously using a G512 however when i had some issues Logitech just sent me this.",
      "An overall great keyboard with consistent key presses.",
      "Best keyboard I ever used.",
      "I love the tactile feel of this keyboard. Admittedly, it's overpriced.",
      "i lost my r key",
      "Expensive, but worth it. Keys are much better than my Romer-G switches on my G910. Didn't go for clicky or linear because I don't want an obtrusively loud keyboard, and I use my keyboard for typing long papers, respectively. Battery life is amazing, even with the lights on. My only gripe is that there is a bit of key wobble, but it is fine by me."

      "Best keyboard I've own, period. Didn't want to mess with custom keyboards so this was very close to perfection out of the box. I just changed the keycaps to some PBT ones since they didn't offer the PBT default ones for my language.",
      "The best gaming keyboard I've ever had the pleasure of using. Its easily modible and can be moved into different cases.\nMine is currently in a Tofu 60 Redux.\nIve used the Lekker Linear60 (Green), 50G Springs, Lekker Linear45 (Yellow) , Jades, and the Stickyrice. I have to say the sticky rice are an incredible upgrade.",
      "Love the sound and speed.",
      "The best keyboard I've ever owned. The constant quality of life updates really make it shine and the analog Lekker switches are absolutely fantastic if you want to play GTA or any open world game with driving and want the controller feel this is the way to go",
      "My long struggle to replace an old Corsair K70 eventually found this. I often find myself under hitting the spacebar, and the wooting's ability to make individual keys super sensitive really helped with that.\nIt's also an incredibly fast board in general with tachyon mode and rapid trigger, excellent for getting those 360 Awp quickswitch no-scopes in CS."

      "Good keyboard, although fairly loud. Clicky and clacky all the way home but the build quality is good and lights are non-invasive. I bought renewed on Amazon and have no complaints about that process.",
      "Fantastic keyboard for the price. He was looking at some cheaper ones, saying that they are just keyboards. However, I explained that a keyboard (and mouse) are the two most used computer items and to get something that is quality. He used my G513 already, and wanted something similar but not as expensive. They had this on display at the MC store and he was hooked!",
      "The brown switches offer a gentle, but not very \"clicky\" response. Each key is individually lit, so I wish there was customization through the G HUB software (lighting levels, responsive keys, etc.) because sometimes the settings of key-lit settings don't stick after reboots/power-cycles. However, for now it seems to be a pretty simple, functional, and useful keyboard."

      "The brown/tactile feels better than the red/linear version and not any louder. Works with the new Windows 11 Dynamic Lighting feature: this changes your keyboard and mouse lights to match your PC theme automatically, and one of the benefits is you get real cool built-in colour effects and animations while playing for example Borderlands 3 or Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (with no setup required).",
      "Love how the buttons feel as I'm typing. I prefer smaller keyboards, and this one fits the bill. Nicest keyboard I've ever owned. Still confused as to why it's Micro-USB instead of USB-C, but that's a small personal gripe.",
      "Great mechanical keyboard. I got the tactile one and very happy with it. Long battery life, nice lighting and typing.",
      "Decent wireless mechanical keyboard - mostly got it for the physical volume scroll and other dedicated media keys. Apart from that, I prefer my Keychron K2 w/ brown switches to this in every way shape and form. Really annoying that a keyboard from 2020 does not charge via USB-C when the rest of Logitech's Lightspeed series mice had already gone to USB-C by that point. Also annoying that you can't sync multiple Lightspeed devices (like the G502 mouse) to the same dongle.",
      "great keyboard that i got renewed off of amazon that worked fine. saying you can get this thing for 100 dollars off, its a steal.",
      "Good.",
      "One of the best wireless keyboards out there, in terms of response time, battery life and overall comfort of typing this keyboard is amazing. These Logitech LightSpeed tech is superb.",
      "Without a doubt the nicest keyboard I've ever owned, and I bought it used for a massive discount. Between the low-profile keys, the RGB backlighting, and the navy blue anodizing of the casing, the aesthetics are fantastic. The volume scroller is a great feature that I really appreciate.\nI can't really detect the tactile 'bump' of the keys unless I'm really feeling for it, but that's probably just because I have sausage fingers. Also, for some reason my F1 key likes to get stuck on yellow; I don't know whether that's by design or just from previous use, but it just takes that one key a little while to get with the program. Not worth taking off a star in my opinion, just putting it out there.\nThe one problem I have with it is that it's USB-micro charging. It's not a huge problem to have an additional charging cable tucked behind my monitor, it just would have been nice to have USB-C.",
      "Good quality, good battery life and wireless.",
      "This is the first high end keyboard I’ve ever owned, so I can’t really compare it to anything else. Despite this, I really enjoy this keyboard. It’s nice and compact thanks to being TKL. The low profile mechanical switches look sleek and feel nice. The build quality of the keyboard is excellent, being entirely aluminum. It’s battery life is excellent"

I like the multimedia buttons - it has a volume wheel and a single button that can pause/play music. That same button can also skip a song and go back a song. I do not use those functions very regularly, but it is good they are there. For some reason, I really like the Escape key. It feels good to look at and press. For anywhere between $35-50, I highly recommend this keyboard.",

      "I had actually bought the DHARMA, the same but TKL, but it wasn't available on here so I just picked this one for the build since it's functionally the same. A nice sturdy board. Coming from a laptop, the red keys are nice and not as loud as other switches.",
      "This is a really good keyboard for the price. I have had this thing for about 3 years and it is awesome. The only gripe i have about it is that it is a little loud and my escape key requires you to press it multiple time for it to work, however it just recently started this. But it does come with 8 extra switches to swap out I have already use 5 of them and tried to change the escape key, but nothing is fixing it. So i think is is a circuit board issue. Besides that, this is an amazing keyboard that is super responsive, comes with 15 color presets (so you dont even have to install the software to change it, which is a huge plus) and is certainly a solid pick for anyone on a budget.",
      "nice sounding board with enough keys for games like Minecraft",
      "This is one of the used parts I salvaged from my previous build. I made the purchase four years ago with the assumption that it should be more than adequate for my future builds. Keyboard works great still and I really enjoy the brown switches.",
      "Fantastic mechanical keyboard. Typing with it is a dream compared to membranes. Color schemes are plentiful, and the LEDs are bright. Can be used as a bludgeoning-type weapon in a pinch.",
      "A great entry level mechanical keyboard; The outemu browns feel indistinguishable from real cherry switches (though they sound a bit different) and the keycaps feel nice. It's a bit bulky but if you're buying a full 104 key board you're probably not concerned about that. RGB is good and the ability to control it without software is a nice touch, as are the function keys and win lock.",
      "Affordable mechanical keyboard. Have had trouble with getting the proper driver for this keyboard but honestly it doesn't matter for me. Works well and being cheaper, its perfect for my first build",
      "For the price, this keyboard is pretty great. They keyboard is fairly heavy, so it's rare that you'd see any sort of keyboard sliding or even moving of that sort unless you were purposefully moving it. This model came with Outemu brown switches, which I personally really enjoy the feel of. It's a great middle of the road between having the audible response of a mechanical keyboard while also not waking up the entire neighborhood with your typing.\nAs far as RGB goes, while the LEDs are individual, it works by presets. This means that if you had any custom preset option for lighting that you had in mind, you're out of luck on that end. However though, the lights are quite vibrant and unless you're going for a super unique customized look, the presets that come on the keyboard should more than suffice. If you have the money to, switch out the keycaps with the HyperX PBT pudding keycaps, it's well worth it.",
      "Good solid mechanical keyboard. Brown switches that make typing very smooth. A bit louder than cheap keyboards that I was used to. Lots of lighting effects and options which are easily configured with no need for extra software. Simply hold function and press specific keys to change lighting effects, color, and brightness."

      "You get what you get for the price ig. It is a really crappy keyboard tho, would reccomend just spending more money.",
      "Does what I need it to, feels good, just wish it had built in battery that I could charge. Very long battery life if you turn it off when not using though.",
      "It's a cheap wireless mouse/keyboard combo and the keyboard is bendy enough to prove it.\nHowever, this is a great purchase. The keyboard and mouse work off the same one USB connector, neither have had any issues with communication with the computer, both are energy efficient and I've yet to need to replace the batteries.\nHad I not been insistent on getting a \"gaming mouse\" I've yet to need for actual gaming, I would have bought this for my own computer as well. That said, it does feel weird using the mouse because it's smaller but \"taller\" than my own gaming mouse but that's a \"me\" issue.\nI would definitely buy this for any new computer builds I do.",

      "Seems to be hard to find a normal keyboard nowadays in any offline store - this one was closest to a normal layout (F-key row is oddly small and no right winkey(???)) but it was wireless. $25 and feels like it. I had to run a USB extension because the dongle would drop signal if it is more than 1' away from the keyboard. The mouse it comes with feels like a toy, It felt so light that a sneeze could send it off my desk.",

      "This keyboard is fantastic. I love the tactile feel of the cherry mx blues and with the ICUE software I am able to have some awesome looking effects. The only downside to this keyboard is it's definitely not waterproof but it was my fault lol",
      "Typing on mine right now. MX Blues are my favorite and the red lighting is nice. I prefer red because it doesnt sting my eyes in the dark. Lighting settings are great with a custom profile built in and 4 levels of light from the keys. Included keycap puller works great. Best of all this keyboard has super solid construction. Metal plate holding all the surface. Thick braided cable and the USB pass through is super nice. Corsair has my business for life on the keyboard side of things if they can maintain this level of function and quality. Highly recommend",
      "You ever been working late at night in the next room and are trying to be quiet so the wife can sleep? This is the keyboard for you! (sarcasm!!!) I've used MX Blues before and know how loud the click is. If you still like the tactile feel, but don't want the click, opt for browns. The red LED has three brightness levels (four, if you count off), though I usually keep mine on the lowest setting. There is a Windows key lock, and an FPS lighting profile button that just illuminates the arrow keys, number keys from 1-6, and WASD (though I believe you can change what keys are illuminated). The media keys are awesome. There is a large mute button, next to a steel or aluminum textured volume roller (definite extra points for this), there is also a (stop, previous song, play/pause, next song) button row right above the numpad. Dedicated media keys are always a plus, especially if they feel good and work right, as these do both. The included wrist rest is nice, and it is the same length all the way across, so perfect for typing. There are both front and rear pop-out feet that are rubberized when closed and opened.\nIt also comes with 10 replacement keys. These keys are textured red, and angled intelligently. It comes with 1-6 in red with rough bumpy texture, with number 1 being angled to the right, and number 6 being angled to the left. It also comes with WASD in red, bumpy texture. The A is angled to the right, and the D is angled to the left. S is flat, and W is angled towards you. Clearly these replacements are for FPS. The key puller tool that it comes with is the cheap black plastic ring claw one, the claw teeth aren't long enough, so you have to press down a couple of times to get it to grab. A nicer wire one would have been appreciated.\nTime for my only gripes with this keyboard: 1. There is only one USB pass-through and it is barely even adequate to charge a smart phone. 2. The sleeved cable which goes back about 3 feet before splitting into two USB cables is much too thick, it is so thick it knocks stuff around on my desk if I have to slide my keyboard forward 3. The Corsair Gaming logo is tacky... it does honestly look like a tramp stamp, and since this is my professional keyboard, with the Logitech G910 Orion Spark being my gaming keyboard, it is definitely out of place. A classic Corsair Sails logo would be appreciated (which I've heard they've gone back to)\n5/5 regardless, the keyboard is immaculate, and the design and included extras outweigh the little gripes here and there.",
      "Great keyboard! as my first mechanical keyboard, this is perfect in every way! The aluminum body makes this keyboard feel premium, lights make it easy to see in the dark and makes the keyboard in my opinion look awesome, also has some useful media switches along with a windows key lock button and a button to select certain keys to light up. Definitively will recommend to others."

      "Tested it out for the first time in my local best buy and it was the only keyboard with keys I liked that weren't super loud or felt crumby. Got it as a gift for Christmas and was so excited to test it out.\nThe bad: At first I loved it, until I realized red linear switches are notorious for double key tapping. Had to go into windows settings and turn key repeat and delay all the way down (thanks to a short from MetaPCs for the fix) but it would still double press on occasion. That would make games with precise inputs (like helldivers 2) impossible. I was going to switch back to my cheapo cyberpower mechanical until recently, where I went into iCue and set the key depress delay to 5ms and it made it better. Sucks I had to do that but it's better now.\nThe good: Love the way the keys depress and it's super quiet and smooth. Made of very heavy materials and uses very thick and grippy rubber feet to keep it locked into place. Love the tactile knob that's programmable for different uses, I'm using it for volume control. The RGB is awesome and lots of different patterns and colors. The use of the iCue app makes everything super customizable of that's your thing. Me, I want a plug and play keyboard and only want to change cosmetics.\nOverall, it would be a much better keyboard without linear switches or easier to find guides how to fix the double key presses. The amount of work I've put into it has made it better but gifting this to someone else without them knowing how much they need to customize it would ruin a friendship.",
      "Nice feel and size. I am getting some double-clicking, which kinda sucks. You can change the double-click sensitivity in the iCUE software, which almost entirely fixes it for me. RGB-Customizable with several hardware memory profiles in the software."

      "Absolutely amazing KB. Bought used, and it looked brand new and functions as expected.",
      "what can i say but holy **** is thing keyboard amazing, im typing with it now and am loving every moment of it, perfect key travel, satisfying click, very responsive buttons, beautiful rgb, absolutely everything you could ever ask for, makes gaming snappy and typing enjoyable",
      "My first mechanical keyboard and I'm loving it so far. Battery life is great, and the RGB is as well. I could totally understand someone not wanting to buy this due to the price though.",
      "Highly niche and highly expensive, but if you seriously want a wireless mechanical keyboard with clicky switches, then you'll know it's worth it by sheer dint of there being no other product that fits the description. The rest of the board—build quality, design, lighting, software, extra features—does match the price to the best degree it can, so Logitech did genuinely make a good product in the abstract and you're not just paying an exclusivity tax, but it's still a price you're only going to pay if you want this specific switch style without a permanent cord attached.\nOne specific thing I haven't heard mentioned in professional reviews much if at all, but that has quickly become my favorite thing about the board—I'm not sure what the low-profile design has to do with being wireless (if anything), but MX Blue-style feedback coupled with the key height and travel distance of a laptop keyboard is a typing and gaming dream. I was hitting better WPM numbers with this board than with any other I've ever owned within a day of getting it, and just by common sense my keypresses in-game are faster because I don't need to depress the key as far to actuate it. I've gained the faster response time and greater typing output that, say, an MX Red or MX Speed board would afford me without giving up any of the satisfying and reassuring Blue-style tactical feedback, and it's absolutely amazing."

      "Excellent keyboard with nice sounding keys (I got them in MX Cherry Red). The display on the top right of the keyboard is kinda useless, but still a good keyboard!!",
      "One of the best keyboards I’ve ever had for their price. The screen is pretty mediocre. The software is really good. My biggest surprise is that the keyboard synchronized with another game I was playing, such as counter strike. The lights would show my ammo, bomb going off, and the screen would display my end of the round kd. Really amazing. I like the switches. Not too clicky, not too quiet.",
      "-Sold on the RGB but the unsung heroes are the Red – Linear & Quiet mechanical keys.",
      "Super nice typing experience. I had a K95 with Browns before this and I can confidently say these are better.",
      "i love it, the sound and feel is amazing",
      "tldr: this keyboard is good.\nActual review: Ok so I really like this keyboard. Mine has the Red switches and I'm a huge fan of how they feel. They go down smooth and typing with them is a nice experience. Gaming with them is great as well, i've never had a problem where a keypress is not detected or any issues with ghosting. The backspace key is SUPER easy to press. I had a crappy keyboard before this one and the backspace and enter keys sometimes just did not depress when I hit them. This one does not have that problem.\nThe screen is pretty cool. Despite what some might tell you it is NOT useless. In normal use I can have snazzy image on there as I don't see much use for the other apps, but for gaming I personally set it to monitor RAM usage, CPU usage and temps, and GPU usage and temps. It's very useful for that as while I do have a second monitor, OpenHardwareMonitor clogs up actually useful stuff on there like discord or spotify. I like monitoring this stuff in case there's a critical error or the like. It also lets you customize macros (which I have not yet found a use for) and the color scheme on the keyboard which is pretty frickin' sweet. The volume wheel is nice and a lot easier to use than the buttons most other keyboards have and the pause/play/skip/back/whatever button is nice as well. It fits in all the functionality and MFD control into a smaller package. overall, the screen IS a gimmick, but it is a welcome one in my world.\nThe font is very very nice. Some other keyboards have like stupid \"gamer\" fonts and highlighted WASD (looks awful even if you use WASD) and this font is very nice, readable, and looks sick with the RBG on. The keycaps are ABS, however, I do not mind this. Some others might tho. I do have one major gripe with the keycaps though: on these keys: - = [ ] ; ' , . / \\ the main function, which is listed there, is ABOVE the shift functions which are _ + { } : \" < > ? | respectively, and this is super annoying. I don't mind it on the number row for some reason but it's annoying on these. It's not enough to retract a star in my book however.\nThe wrist rest is very interesting. I'm not sure what it's made of, but it is definitely something hard, but for some reason it feels soft?? like you touch it and it's like a bedsheet or something but rigid. It's super weird and i love it! it's pleasing to wrest your wrists on and does its job well. The steelseries logo on the rest looks super nice as well.\nI was originally skeptical of getting a TKL keyboard, but overall I am very happy with my choice. Even though I have never used the numberpad it was hard to let go of it...and then I saw the difference in price and never looked back. Seriously though, I'm happy I ditched it, I have a LOT more desk space (it's mind boggling how something that small can take up so much room) and I still get to keep the M keys and arrow keys in a good spot. I personally enjoy them there rather than all bunched up with no breathing room like in a laptop keyboard. Them, the F keys, the screen, the font, and the backlighting all give this keyboard a beautiful visual balance and it's honestly kind of a work of art. I'm beyond satisfied with my choice and would definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone.",
      "Works amazingly well, buttery smooth switches. -1 star for rgb software not being the greatest.",
      "can rickroll people. 5/5",
      "Great for tight spaces (or small people like me), RGB customization on point, cool display USB passthrough for mouse is cool. Feels premium, especially the wrist-rest.",
      "Great mechanical keyboard no ghosting, matte finish on the keys and steel-series engine 3 is great software. Only annoyance is that it doesn't save small image preset when software is closed."

      "Great quality and RBG for the price. Red keys can be sorta annoying sometimes with how light they are ahah.",
      "Very nice TKL mechanical keyboard. It has a clean and simple design that I think looks great. The HyperX Red switches are good I don't mind having ABS keycaps on a sub-$100 keyboard. No included wrist rest is a bummer but I bought a Grifiti one on Amazon that works well enough (beware: it reeks for the first few days). HyperX NGENUITY is lightweight and well designed, and controls the key mapping, RGB lighting, etc. This is a good option for an all-around pleasant experience."

On the leds is already burned out but I dont really care so much about that as much as the typeface they have used on the keys is very hard to read. I expect clear letter and symbols on a keyboard. This is not that great in that department. The 8 and the 9 are almost identical ad are 5 and 6.

      "While this board is not in my current setup, It was a very solid keyboard with hot-swap capability meaning I can use my gateron and kailh switches. While only the top-plate is aluminum, it still sounds nice with its pre-installed foam and factory tape mod. Also supports screw in stabilizers which I used but the stock plate-mounted ones are also pretty nice with minimal rattle. Even comes with a nice wrist rest."

      "I'm not a mechanical keyboard enthusiast, so keep that in mind. The space bar is a different switch from every other key, slightly louder. The build quality is solid, but the font on the keyboard is inconsistent-letters are sometimes spaced badly or vary in thickness. There's a single white adjustable LED under each key, but that makes for nonuniform lighting under keys with longer words, like enter/shift if that bothers you. Or you could just turn the backlight off. No default play/pause audio or volume control or brightness control. However, Windows PowerToys solves that issue. But the main positive is the price, as of writing this it is under $50 on Amazon, which is incredible.",
      "Amazing budget keyboard with cherry mx red switches. The only possible negatives to this thing in my mind are that it doesn't have any RGB or dedicated media controls. The white backlit LED looks great, though, and not having media controls is completely understandable at its price point for me. If you're looking for a budget mechanical keyboard and are a fan of cherry mx switches, this is simply the best there is.",
      "I love this keyboard because it's a great build for the price, and feels really solid. There isn't any RGB, but frankly that wasn't something that I need and it the white backlight works with my current setup anyways.",
      "Loving this keyboard so far. It looks really clean next to a white pc build. Only wish the fn (function) key could be used to raise/lower sound and volume. I'm not super crazy into keyboards so I can't really put any valuable input into how the switches and key caps feel, but they feel and sound nice to me."

      "Sweet keyboard. Thing is durable too, I've taken it on quite a few trips and its survived. Easy as hell to clean, I don't even have to take the keycaps off, just blast canned air into it.",
      "Amazing little keyboard. Feels amazing to use, very durable, and has tons of options for lighting with the iCUE software. I've never had a single issue with this keyboard over the past 9.5 months I've had this. Comes with an additional spacebar and esc keycap with a keycap remover. I would recommend buying a keycap remover off of Amazon for dirt cheap just for better durability and longevity, but it's up to you. Thanks again, Corsair!",
      "Great keyboard that has an 8000hz pooling rate and has a very easy to use and overall good rgb software, would recommend for competitive gaming.",
      "Great keyboard for the price, super fast response time and nearly no input delay. The rgb is great and Corsair icue was relatively easy to use. However this keyboard is so loud my parents hear me typing on it from downstairs.",
      "Clicky and small :)",
      "Comfortable keyboard to type on, well balanced red switches with good stabilisation. RGB is clear and vivid, with easy control through either iCUE or Signal RGB. Only gripes is that the chassis could be thinner or come with a wrist rest to mitigate wrists bending so much upwards.",
      "I tried to hate this keyboard after I bought it. All the keyboard snobs scoff at these name brand boards and go on about boutique sellers. But so far I can't help but love it. I got the speed switches, since it was the only option at my local best buy (I think you need to buy direct from corsair for reds). They feel so good to press down on. Build quality is fine, the plastic chassis doesn't bother me, it is at least sturdy feeling plastic. I love the look of the lighting; it reflects off the white plate on top of the pcb and bathes the area around the keys in color. You can even change the rgb on the board via function keys without software open, in addition to saving profiles to the board. The sound of the keys doesn't bother me much, I added foam to dampen it a bit. It's a bit pricey for a small keyboard, but not by too much I don't think. I wouldn't buy this for productivity typing due to the nature of 60%, but for gaming and casual use it is great!",
      "bussin",
      "Loving it! I got the white one to match my build. Works great with the many ICUE designs. The slanted profile of the keycaps throws me off and the \"silent\" switches are a little loud but other than that, a great choice. They also include a keycap puller and extra space/esc keys.",

      "Clicky switches are so satisfying, and very cool, along with the colorful keys, and its amazing compact form, I love this keyboard! If it was wireless, it would be 6 STARS, but still not bad!",
      "My first introduction to 60%. I like it. Before the firmware update it crashed explorer.exe all the time.",
      "Sturdy, light, comfy, looks great, it's easy to play / type on it while sitting in the lotus position. Absolutely nothing bad to mention. Clicky but fast optical switches are nice. USB cable is detachable, braided and long. There's metal plate between the keys and the main plastic body. The only beef I can see people having with it -- is having to use the Razer software package -- Razer Synapse. Though I've been using some variation of it for years and am not bothered by it. Unlike the large and heavy Black Widow X, there's no plastic squeaking when handling it. It's been around 6 months since I got it, to use with a different PC originally, and all the LEDs are working well.",
      "I knew before building this PC I wanted a 60%. This keyboard recently came out, and it is a good starter board. Price is a little steep, but my friend let me use his employee discount, so I was able to get for a pretty good price."

Other then their steelseries engine software being hit or miss, especially if you want it running in the tray while gaming, i would stand by a steelseries product any day (granted im new and have only used razer and steelseries products its just my opinion!)",

      "20 bucks for a mouse and 20 bucks for a keyboard. both have RGB colors for teens, so it was a no brainer. hope that they last a while. I usually buy more expensive I/O devices for me. but for a 9yr old I think this was a decent price for $39.99 for both Mouse and Keyboard. quality yet to be determined... if it survives a 9 yr. old gaming tantrum then we maybe golden. looking over the build quality and materials used, the keyboard looks ok, the mouse looks to me to be more fragile, but we will see.",
      "I bought the WHITE version of this keyboard, but it feels great, has quiet keys (for those of us who tend to pound on the keys pretty hard) and the colors are vibrant and plentiful. I got this for around $40, so I can't complain about it at all. I really think it fits my build nicely - and it's the FIRST thing people notice after the case itself.",
      "I guess you get what you pay for. Keys feel responsive and sturdy and the mouse is comfortable in your hand. However, both look very cheap and plastic-y. The RGB lighting is fine but controlling it is a pain. The keyboard RGB is controlled directly through key presses and it cycles through presets. Occasionally, it forgets which lighting preset you chose upon restarts, which is annoying. The mouse required software to change the RGB and that was extremely hard to find. The manuals were unhelpful and poorly translated and there was no model number provided for the mouse, leaving me to find the correct mouse software through a process of elimination (it's the M601RGB, by the way). Ultimately, both devices perform fine and the price is good for budgets if RGB isn't too important to you.",
      "I actually loved both of the items that came in this package! The keyboard has been flawless the entire time I've owned it, a bonus being the wrist/palm rest, something I didn't have at all with my previous keyboard!\nThe mouse on the other hand... Well, I only got to use it briefly. It was an incredible mouse while I had it, but I ultimately gave it to my cousin for his build. It's serving him incredibly well, though, from what I've learned!",
      "Yeah, sure it's a cheap feeling combo. But it works perfectly for a CASUAL GAMER. The mouse is a bit wonky and it's hard to find a good DPI setting but that's entirely subjective. RGB lighting is great and adjustable. 4 years daily use and not a single problem!",
      "A nice cheap \"RGB\" keyboard with a red-light gaming mouse. The lights won't sync with your other components but there are enough pre-programmed options for the keyboard to find something close enough to whatever else you've got real RGB on.\nThe keyboard has some music-dedicated keys for pause/play, stop, previous and next track, but no dedicated volume button which could be an issue if you don't have a headset/speaker setup that you plan to use exclusively for adjusting the volume.",
      "It's okay. I've been noticing issues with the keys not registering (purchased brand new) and the fact that the lights are continuously flashing. I'm sure there's a way to adjust the lights but I haven't figured it out yet. It's not intuitive on the board. Otherwise, it connects immediately to power.",
      "I knew I was getting a cheap combo here, so I can look past the gummy button feel of the keyboard and lack of lighting control on the mouse. For the price, it looks decent and does the job well. Would recommend to a budget minded builder.",
      "This is a fine starter combo. The kid wanted lights. This has lights. He can upgrade later with his own money if he decides he wants mechanical keys or upgraded mouse options. Good assortment of RGB effects on the keyboard (the mouse is only red). Nice long cables on both components, with the mouse being braided. Should hold up well. Nice powdered finish on the mouse for good grip.\nOne BIG complaint, the plastic casing around the USB connector is so chunk the keyboard and mouse can't occupy side-by-side USB ports on the rear IO panel."

      "Expensive, but best keyboard I've ever used in my life. If this explodes on me, I might get the Azoth extreme edition.",
      "I love this keyboard for all it has. I didn't need the screen, but it's nice. But I'm just a way bigger fan of low profile keyboards.",
      "Bought on sale ($199.99) and it's well worth the premium.\nBattery life is stellar, albeit I turn off the OLED screen and keep the RGB at 25%...\nYou get the custom/enthusiast keyboard quality without all the guess work. I installed ROG Crate on a burner PC to save custom RGB settings on it, so I can't speak of software issues.\nThe lack of a wrist board/pad is the only con, especially for the price (sale or not). It'd be nice to have a magnetic pad, but knowing ASUS/ROG, they'd charge a limb (or two) for it.",
      "This is actually my on-the-go keyboard, but since it's so nice feeling it's now sitting next to my desktop, until I figure out how to sound mod a Wooting Two HE etc for this purpose.\nI was looking for a quiet yet nice feeling wireless keyboard, and the Azoth ticks many boxes with its unique mix of gaming and enthusiast features even out-of-the-box. With the dampening and default switches, it already feels and sounds much cleaner and crisper than a typical gaming keyboard, like my somewhat mushy and pingy Corsair Strafe with MX Silent. Paired with a silent switch like Bobagum/Lucy, and it becomes basically silent. The wireless capability on the Azoth is next to none, with super low latency and super long battery life (one reason why I picked instead of another Keychron Q Pro. Another is the weight). While not as good as a Wooting with analog / custom actuation / rapid trigger, the switch is fairly decent for general gaming.\nThe main issue is that the volume \"toggle\" is horrendous compared to a regular knob. It wobbles a lot, is very easy to misclick to mute, and difficult to adjust to the proper volume level. The gasket mount is also stiffer than I expected, another area where the Keychron Q Pro does better. I have no issues so far with the Armory Crate software, but that one certainly also got a lot of complaints on the Internet. And of course, especially for some game genres, no doubt the Wootings remain superior. Still - as far as wireless gaming or out-of-the-box feel/sound goes, the Azoth is a great option. 4/5 for the terrible volume \"toggle\"."

      "Sounds great and looks very plain, which I prefer over a super flashy design. Also nice having a ton of keys to work with. I'm not a keyboard person but it's been working very well and the keys sound nice and clacky. My only problem is that you can't use the function and multimedia keys at the same time afaik. This wouldn't be a big deal normally, except that a lot of software for 3D modeling, video editing, etc uses the function keys. This makes things pretty inconvenient sometimes, but not too often. Still enough of a problem to bring the rating to 4 stars though...",
      "Awesome starter keyboard, especially as a base for future customization (as long as you like full sized keyboards)!",
      "The gateron pro switches come pre-lubed. Brown switches are just as quiet maybe more so than my cherry reds, was really expecting them to sound in-between reds and blues but they're pretty silent.\nI was worried that the keycaps would be cheap plastic since they're ABS but surprisingly they have a nice texture to them and don't feel flimsy, cheap or greasy/slick at all, not even going to replace them with PBT like i had planned.\nFor the cons: There's a very dim permanent backlight on as far as I can tell, it has a glow in the dark feel to it. And the led indicator for windows/mac toggle is always on which is just a personal gripe.\nOverall the quality feels really high for a $55 keyboard, solid keycaps, hot swappable 3-5 pin, can even go with optical switches. The pre-lubed brown switches are nice and silent, only sound is a solid thock from the larger keys such as spacebar and backspace, that could just be how hard I am hitting them though. Also comes with a usb-c to usb-c cable, with a usb-a adapter for one end.\nHighly recommend this as a solid starter base or just pick it up and leave it as is if you're looking for a solid wired mechanical keyboard. If you want a wireless/bluethooth base look at RK ROYAL KLUDGE RK98 but would keep in mind the cheap Outemu default switches should be swapped out immediately on that board."

      "I'm a little torn on this one. It's definitely got some nice qualities, like the RGB, the metal frame, and the media controls. On the other hand, I think the ergonomics could be a little better... maybe it's personal preference, but I wish the wrist rest was soft and didn't taper down. Also, it's big, which means you'll never be missing a key, but then it takes up a lot of space. I feel like it's a good gaming keyboard, but not the best mechanical keyboard, if that makes any sense? It's got all the \"gaming\" features but it misses a lot of things that the wider enthusiast mechanical keyboard market has, like hot-swappable switches and a detachable cable. Overall, though, it's still a solid keyboard with a fair bit going for it.",
      "If You want a great looking keyboard - look no further. If You want just a mechanical keyboard - there are plenty of cheaper propositions on the market.

I think it is possible to disable but im not 100% sure.\nAfter 15 months \"R\" led starded changing colors after pressing it. During the RMA process Corsair sent to me a completely new keyboard.

      "I have owned this keyboard for about 10 years I think, and it works amazingly. I've never had a problem with it. The USB port on the keyboard makes for a very convenient temporary connection point for tablets and other devices. The G keys are very helpful and probably have saved me dozens of hours with repetitious tasks. The G keys can also be locked so you don't accidentally press them and spam commands in chat. The fact the keyboard doesn't have multiple colors is one of my favorite aspects. Just backlight with white. Additionally, the brightness is adjustable. The volume wheel is very fun to use. The build quality is tremendous. I have moved 6 times with this keyboard. I take it with me to work sometimes to clean it. I have gotten very used to the Cherry MX brown switches on the keyboard, and I purchased this keyboard because it was one of the quiet options I could find to avoid disturbing my ex-wife while she slept but I will try something with a more tactile response in the future. All around have no reason to buy another keyboard until this craps out, and when it does I'll be trying to find something very similar to it.",

      "Has a short range.\nPeople say the trackpad isn’t great, but I think it is, keyboards good too.\nI wish it was backlit.",
      "Hey, please don't try and type on this thing! Use it on your HTPC or for setting up a new PC but don't ever expect to be productive with it.",
      "Hey its cheap and always there to jab a key on the htpc or test bench. Just don't try to type on it.",
      "trackpad will randomly click when scrolling",
      "Very cheap. Works great though. Takes a couple AA batteries and is good for 6-12 months at a time. 5 stars for Logi :D",
      "Bought this as a spare wireless option for the rare times when I bring my PC into the living room for better roomscale VR, just because I need something wireless to control my PC with it. Works flawlessly for the purpose, though the trackpad isn't the most pleasant.",
      "This keyboard is alright. The trackpad was barely usable in Linux, lots of phantom movements. In Windows 10 it is better, but still not great. The keyboard is nice to type on though, and the batteries last forever. For the price, it's pretty good.",
      "Not particularly built well, trackpad is mediocre at best, and keys are pretty smushed. I love it. I use it almost like a TV remote from bed. It's cheap and fills my need perfectly.",
      "Just perfect for HTPC use from the bed or the couch. Impossible to lose. Battery life for months. Takes multiple drops from bed/couch height like a champ. I prefer the original k400, but these pluses work very well too.",
      "Best couch keyboard ever. Doesn't feel cheap and the range is far more than I need. I mean I can co out on my back porch and it still works at that range. The extra left click button on the top left is nice so I can basically hold it like a game controller with my right thumb on the touchpad and left thumb on the left click. I had that keyboard for over a year now and it is still rocking the original pair of AA batteries it came shipped with."

      "I prefer white LEDs and annoying my friends in voice chat, but kinda miss my MX Browns after being on MX Blues for a while.",
      "This baby held itself together through abuse. From water spilling on it to being smashed, it served me well until it was time to retire it.",
      "I love this keyboard.",
      "Absolutely love this keyboard. Stumbled into it for $40 a couple of years ago. It had a minor nick on the corner of the keyboard which is why it was discounted. Couldn't be happier with it. It's immensely satisfying to type on with the cherry switches. It's awesome for gaming. The only thing I would change about it would be that I wish it was RGB so I could play around with the lighting on it. That's a very minor gripe though, this keyboard is perfect outside of that. I am planning a new build in the nearer future and I think I'll probably still use this keyboard because I love it so much.",
      "This is my first mechanical keyboard and its great .The keys are responsive, the build quality is definitely above average though not as high as some of the keyboards in its price range. NO RGB but that doesn't really bother me. The lighting is also non uniform for some of the larger keys but at least the white LEDs are actually white and not the pinkish, greenish or yellowish white that you get with most RGB keyboards. Only the 6 G-keys can be reassigned which isn't on par with some other keybaords that allow remapping of all keys. It feels like it's going to last a very long time. I ended up buying damper rings to reduce the noise of the keyboard because the blue switches are fairly loud. I will probably replace this Keyboard with a Razer Blackwidow Chroma V2 because it has a much nicer wrist rest.",
      "Was actually gifted to me from a friend. This keyboard is backlit, no RGB or anything. No complaints, the keys are a little loud but thats what you get these keys.",
      "Great feeling but pretty loud.\nFun story, I also have a friend who has the same keyboard. This keyboard is apparently loud enough to irritate his dog. Everytime he presses a key, his dog will bark at the keyboard, LMAO",
      "Once you go clack, you never go back! Also, once 18 custom macros for all your lenny needs. 4 levels of backlighting and you can choose to have wasd and the arrow keys lit separately! The volume wheel is a nice bonus, I love not having to go to settings to change the volume of a game!",

      "A bit over the top \"gamer\" looking, but it matches well with my Logitech G430 headset, and the cherry MX blue switches are absolutely wonderful and I love typing and gaming on them. I got this for a steal on Black Friday, but I would go with something from corsair or otherwise if I were buying at full price. I do like the volume roller and media keys on this keyboard though. Feels top notch and a drastic improvement from the scissor switches my laptop used."

The description doesn’t list it, but the keyboard also comes in black and with different keys and can also have different switches, such as reds and browns for quieter clicks.

      "Surprisingly heavy. I don't have a comparison because I came from scissor switches. Not blues because who the hell uses blues. Seems pretty high quality for the price ? One thing I'd say is that I have sweaty hands and that does begin to show up on the keycaps real quick",
      "had this keyboard for a while in brown switches, the only complaint i have is that the stabilizers becomes early after a while but the rgb looks good",

      "For the price theres better boards,but a nice \"gaming\" keyboard,would still get something from akko or keychron rather than it,but didn't know those exist at the time I bought this.\nThe software is coinflip,its great one day then the next you wanna rip your hair out.",
      "After 6 months of use, the space bar has picked up a wobble, and the \"killer app\" USB C has gotten more common. It's still an ok keyboard and the control software has been fine, but there are better options on the market now.",
      "Awesome board, great quality for a solid gaming/work keyboard",
      "Great to type on, great to game on, lighting profiles are easy to use and convenient to have.\nDefinitely recommend getting the gel wrist rest with it as well. Gets you hands at a comfortable level to the keyboard."
