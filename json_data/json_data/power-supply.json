      "There were a few issues with the PSU, such as some of the cables not clicking in properly. This meant I could pull them out without the latch engaging. I also hear a slight \"coil whine\" when the PC is under heavy load, but other than that, it seems to be functioning fine. It was one of the more affordable, mid-range PSUs, so I’m not too concerned, but it’s something to keep in mind, maybe go for something more expensive.",
      "Very nice reliable PSU. I was told when building this PC to not go cheap on the PSU, so I got this. Plenty of power for my system, and comes with a ton of cables.",
      "Smells weird but that’s normal and it runs great",
      "Works great and has not blown up, really all i need from a PSU.",
      "This is a solid B tier, pretty high value and quality power supply at a small size. It comes with plenty of 4+4pin ATX and 6+2 pin PCIe power connectors, along with SATA and MOLEX if required in a modular format. It also supports the 16pin PCIe connector natively, albeit at only 450 watts. It provides stable power even directly from the wall (which isn’t the recommended, get a surge protector or UPS). The only downside I have experienced is the loud noise of the fan. It is louder than all the other 9 fans in my build combined by a long shot.",
      "Great PSU for the price, but super loud even at idle.",
      "Love the MAG series from MSI. Cables are labeled which are convenient and its quiet and reliable.",
      "Hasn't failed me yet.",
      "Great PSU for everything I need!",
      "Does its job, but cables are stiff. Makes cable management difficult, but nothing a few zip ties can't fix."

      "didnt exploded (yet), and the cables are pretty easy to manage. But i highly recommend buying modular PSU if u have some money, so much easier",
      "A staple in budget builds, this PSU is great value and rated highly on the cultist network PSU tier list. Picked this one up on sale, for even better value.",
      "Great for the price. Just the normal complaints. Non-modular cable are annoying. But great psu.",
      "it's a psu",
      "Probably the best 650W PSU you could get, especially for 52€. Works very well and easy to install. Only downside is since it is not modular, it makes cable management harder, especially with this case."

This 2023 Corsair RM1000e was on rollback/discount pricing for $115 brand new, making this the only identical item that was cheaper than what I paid for in my build from 2023, where I paid $150, the RM1000e is typically listed at $170 as of April 2025 (there's also a newer model with a direct 12VHPWR connection though.)",

This is way, way more wattage than I'll ever need, both now and in the future, but I got a good deal on this one.\nI've also heard these units can have noticeable coil whine sometimes. Guess what this particular unit does. :(",

Went straight to Best Buy, and this was the best PSU they stocked. It looked decent with a zero fan mode but little did I know... This is the loudest freaking PSU I have ever heard.... Sounds like a 1.8 F4 at like 6,000 RPM dude Some people say that the RMx isn't like this (this is the RMe) Don't buy the \"zero fan mode.\" Just don't. At least it didn't blow up like the Thermaltake 😭",

      "The renowned RMx series and brand new out 2024 version, PCIe 5.1 & ATX 3.1 ready for my future planned upgrade to a 9070xt/5080, comes with nice premium feel cables, lots of connection slots for sata/PCIe, and the usually Corsair quality feel.

This should be obvious to most people here, but for the few who are somewhat green, don't skimp out and at the very least get a semi-modular or smaller-sized unit. There is probably a quarter inch of clearance between this and the optical drive in my build, so the very stiff cables took great difficulty to move out of the way and the excess just have to hang out, thankfully out of the way of the CPU fan.",

      "Good PSU for my use, I have like 200-250w headroom so it doesn't blow up. 4 stars because way too many cables, but it's old so it makes sense to have a lot of useless connectors.",

      "Seems to work and comes with a nice selection of braided cables. Also comes with a 7 year warranty.",
      "Compact and quiet SFX PSU, Corsair the GOAT.",
      "The cables are high-quality and braided, which makes them look nice and also bend easier. That is especially important in small form factor builds like this PSU is meant for. The plugs on the PSU are small too, further shrinking the footprint of the cables.",
      "It works and it's probably gonna last me a long time. Fan has never spun up under desktop use and included cables feel really nice. The go-to SFF power supply for a reason.",
      "My review of this power supply may be unfair for now, as I barely even reach the 850 watts of its capacity. However, the fans haven’t kicked on once, and there’s no annoying coil whine like some ASUS power supplies. So far, it's been pretty awesome. The cables included in the box are high-quality and phenomenal, and I highly recommend using them instead of spending extra money on third-party cables. My only gripe is that I wish the screws included to mount the PSU into the case were black, but that’s a minor issue. I ended up anyways using the included screws with the case anyways.",
      "Cables were quite tough to use/manage effectively.",
      "hella expensive and the cables are confusing if you don't read the manual he he... it took me 30min to find the PCIE cables... great psu tho:)",
      "I love this PSU. Its efficient, powerful and after tax i got it for the same price that the 750 was MSRP. The only reason it gets a star deducted from me is because of the Zero RPM mode. I'm not a huge fan of it but its mainly nit picking, it just gets a bit warm is all. Good PSU with amazing Corsair quality that should last a good long time.",
      "I had the 2018 version, and it was great. Same goes for the 2024 build — super quiet.",
      "got it on sale on black Friday cool little compact psu I like it and the cables are sleeved so that's nice. FYI the stock cables are short for itx build so if you are building in a micro atx case you will need different cables."

      "I got this PSU since it has an excellent efficiency rating on the Cybenetics PSU database for 2% load and 20-80 W loads, meaning it's great at idle (which is what I expect my home server to be doing 90+% of the time).\nThe box didn't come with a physical user manual, but only showed a QR code where I could get the electronic version online. However, this link was dead, and I can't find the manual anywhere. Not that it actually matters, since installing and using it is pretty straightforward.\nIt comes with both straight and right angle SATA power cables, which is pretty nice, since you can use whichever helps maintenance and cable management more. The PCIe power cable (for GPUs), however, is just a single cable with a pigtail for two PCIe connectors, which isn't optimal. However, I don't plan on running a powerful GPU with this server at all (maybe a small GPU for transcoding), so it's fine for me.\nOtherwise, this PSU works well, no issues.",
      "Great modular design.",
      "Using for a home server/NAS. Works fine. Cables are easy enough to manage. Gold rated, reputable brand for PSUs.",
      "Following the minimum wattage from PCPP, I went this unit. It doesn't randomly shut off and it's quiet. Zero complaints.",
      "Pretty good quality PSU for the price. Only complaint is the cables are very stiff which made building a bit frustrating at times.",
      "Very high quality power supply.",
      "Lables on all the cords making first time building a breeze. Great product.",
      "It gives power. I may have heard it speak up or rattle once or twice, but it’s definitely not a consistent problem. Cable management was smooth, barring the fact that the PCle cable between the heads was juuuust too short to let me hide the spare back in the case. Good performance absolutely makes up for that one, though.",
      "Looks like a good PSU in terms of modularity and specs, but not noise. My unit has noticeable coil whine and its fan makes a rattling, almost engine-like noise when spinning up to speed. It would've been less noticeable if the fan started with the PC and worked continuously, but instead there's a 130W threshold for silent mode, so any decent workload makes it go on and off pretty often. It's not too bad, but the coil whine is annoying. Might RMA the unit for that.",
      "It's a power supply. What else can I say?\n10/10 would buy again. I mean, it's not a low-yield dirty bomb (unlike some other PSUs), so it's great."

      "I'm a hobby builder. Have purchased at least half a dozen of these over the past six months. Have not had the first issue with any of them. Though they are in PC systems built to be sold. So, I do not have first hand experience on longer term quality or durability. They sound plenty quiet for a US$50 PSU. They look good. All black flat cables.\nSegotep is a 20+ year old company. Their 750W & 850W \"GM\" PSUs are rated \"Tier B\" at the PSU Cultists Network and \"Gold Efficiency\" & \"A- Noise\" at Cybenetics Labs. So, I think the manufacturer has reasonable credibility. I've not seen a better value on a 650W 80+ Gold PSU. Plus, even Corsair & Seasonic have sold \"Tier F - replace immediately\" units per the PSU Cultists Network. So, brand name is no guaranty either way.\nNOTE: The Newegg description is INCORRECT. This unit is NOT ATX 3.0 & PCIe 5.0 Ready. It appears Newegg copied the description from the 750W \"GM\" PSU rather than this 650W \"GN\" PSU. The Amazon description looks correct."

Not sure if that’s because my idle load is high enough with a 7800X3D and a 4080 Super or if they actually fixed the clicking when switching from idle to load.

It did feel worryingly lightweight and the hotdog condiment looking cables didn't help much.",
      "A snazzy unit that does what is advertised.",
      "Biggest problem with my build as I see it is this weak psu. If considered as a budget system that got a GPU upgrade, it makes sense here, but we are bumping up against the metaphorical ceiling here. I bought a 850w replacement before the return window closed, but problems arose once it was in and had to return it and was stuck with the wimpy 600w. All this said, I've experienced no crashes thus far.",
      "Cringing, gritting my teeth flipping the switch,\nit did not explode! It do be supplying power doe.",
      "It's a power supply, and it supplies power. The cords aren't perfect, they're super rigid and the design for the PCI-E in particular isnt great considering how rigid the wires are. But you plug it in and it works so it's not bad if you don't care about looks",
      "A power supply unit that supplies power at the rate a power supply should supply power. Good to build with, flexible cables and sturdy connectors. I'm not a big fan of the ketchup and mustard cables at this price range, but I'm stingy so I won't count it against them. Should keep up just fine for the coming years.",
      "Solid, ketchup and mustard is a bit ugly buy you can't really see it in this build. Well priced and respectable brand",
      "Again, I cheaped out on the power supply, going with a Thermaltake Toughpower GX2 600 watt 80+ gold. It's pretty overkill for my current computer, but I do hope to get a dedicated graphics card in the future which will need the extra power.",
      "As much as I love modular power supplies, this one did the trick just fine. I was able to fold up the cables I didn't use and tuck them away neatly."

Consult the Cultists Tier List Source Spreadsheet for more info, and do not make a purchase based on the subjective data in this review.\nThat said, this is a solid unit. True SFX, reliable, plenty of wattage*, gets the job done. Fully modular and the cables are nice.\nHowever, it is not quiet, not loud enough to be annoying but audible over good quality CPU/GPU cooling at moderate loads. The advertised semi-passive operation up to 40% load is false; the fan kicks on with a vengeance around 175-200 W of full system draw. My particular example also came with the EPS connectors tangled through each other in a way that was impossible to separate.\n*a design flaw causes the 850W version of this unit to get flaming hot at its full capacity. I would personally treat this unit as a 700 W since it has the same component choice.",

      "Very cool PSU\nThe best ATX 3.1 PSU you can get. Aesthetically pleasing, robust power delivery, silent operation and braided cables out of the box. However, it is incredibly pricey, so only get it if it is your only option, or you have bottomless pockets. There are much better options for better value out there. That being said, if you are buying a many thousand-pound graphics card, spending well on your PSU would be sensible.\nA real issue with this power supply, and many other power supplies for that matter, is that there is no failsafe against the fan failing. That along with it simply too expensive is why I'm taking a star off."

      "Extremely overkill for a 5080, but gives a lot of headroom for safety. I'm currently not using the USB hub so I cannot comment on that, but the option is nice. On a O11D RGB, the mounting is perfect and connecting cables in the rear is very easy. I love the quality of the cables that are also included. The white braided cables look so good with my all white build."

But this one has been tested. If you go on the 80+ website and look for this specific model you'll see the test results that it is indeed 80+ gold.\nAt 50% load it's efficiency is 90.87%. at 100% load it's 89.85%.",

The Thermaltake instructions are generic, and despite having a 12VHPWR connector, they don't support it very well (the cable hardly bends at the angles, and can barely stretch far enough to reach the PSU through a cable management hole).

      "Runs very silent, I couldn’t hear it if I wanted to. It’s also from a reputable brand and the cables are a bit stiff but nothing you can’t overcome. Especially at that price point alongside ATX 3.0 and PCIe 5 support. I recommend!",
      "Great PSU, quiet, efficient and has native 12vHPWR that hasn't melted yet.... crossing my fingers. Got for a steal on black friday.",
      "That's one of the best psus you can get for a little over 100$. You get 10 year warranty and It's just great, very reliable also.",
      "I bought this just for safety (I know I could choose another power supply) but having random power outages in my zone certifies me (at least) that I do not fry my PC nor have a short circuit when turning back on",
      "Delivers power, silent, professionally tested to work very well, compact.\nComes with great cables but too bad I used cable extensions.",
      "Seem to do the job perfectly so far!",
      "quiet PSU, lots of cables in the bundle, and lots of power for this Fridge.",
      "A tier on cultists tier list, 10 year warranty",
      "I usually go with SeaSonic but I can't find any in stock so I gave these a try. It's a very good quality PSU for the price. I'm not a fan of the 12vhpwr cable it came with. It is extremely thick and barely has any flexibility.",
      "Decent PSU, it was either this or the corsair RM850e, this was a little cheaper but still at the top for PSU picks."

      "Wonderful high-end PSU that has been working great for 2 years with plenty of cable ties and accessories included.",
      "Solid power supply from a brand I trust. Quiet too",
      "Very quiet PSU. Technical reviews of this PSU praise its performance.\nIncluded cables are individually sleeved/insulated but a bit more difficult to manage compared to single-sleeve cables.\nThe rigidity of the rear of the casing could be improved slightly as there is some flex when plugging and unplugging the power cable.\nEDIT: November 2024 - My original unit developed an annoying ticking sound in the fan and had to be RMA'd. Seasonic offered an advance RMA in which I had to place a small deposit down. They shipped me a very good condition refurb unit that had a silent fan and actually less electrical noise than the original unit. I sent the original back and they promptly refunded me. My experience with Seasonic has been excellent. If something changes down the line, I will update this.",
      "Has the power to handle any configuration bar the most astronomically overpowered or impractical. With a long warranty, good middling size, and good quality stock cables, it's hard to see myself getting another PSU anytime soon.\nThe VERTEX is a nice middle of the road option compared to the more premium PRIME line and the more basic FOCUS line. This particular one comes with high quality stock cables that are very easy to manage and blend in nicely, unlike the ugly monstrosities I see on even some other \"high end\" units.\nAlso no annoying, unsightly pigtail connectors! Rejoice!",
      "So far it is working as expected - no issues and quiet. Build quality is excellent and the completed selection of supplied cables are easy to work with.",
      "I wanted something that could handle the RX 7900 XTX and any future GPU upgrade with no problem. I went with Seasonic becuase they are synonimous with quality, and I love their warranty. Amazing PSU that stays silent at all loads. Comes with braided cables that are easy to handle and work with, and in my opinion look great! If next I go with team green I'm also set with the included 12VHPWR cable.",
      "seasonic, hard to go wrong. wish it had 1 extra pcie output",
      "Great PSU, easy to work with, and well labeled. Black cables are perfect for this build.",
      "I wanted a quiet and good psu so i searched for many psu brands and came across cybenetics.com which have very through reviews of psu's. This particular psu came out as quiet and efficient so I got it."

      "1000W is a bit overkill for this build but I didn't want to worry about it and I got a great sale price on this at microcenter back in June. Has the 12V cable for 4000 series GPUs so perfect for my build.",
      "came with the right connectors for the new RTX cards and has held up great.",
      "A highly future-proofed PSU. I've heard it's an A-tier PSU. It comes with flat cables, except for the 12VHPWR and motherboard cable, which isn't too bad if you're going to use CableMod. The fan stays very quiet.",
      "Great PSU, really nice quality. I'm using it with the fan on and its silent, no need for zero rpm mode."

      "The Corsair CXM series is my preferred PSU for budget and mid-range builds, and are far better power supplies than what the 80 Plus Bronze certification would indicate. The CX750M 2021 model retails for $80 USD, which isn't much cheaper than fully modular 750 W Gold units from other reputable brands, but if you can swing a deal on a used unit in decent condition for less than $40 USD, I’d say it’s worth considering.\nPros:\nperformance; Cybenetics-certified Silver Efficiency / A- Noise rating\nsemi-modular\n100% Japanese 105 °C capacitors\n5-year manufacturer’s warranty\nCons:\nstock cables; bulky, stiff, and ugly; sleeved aftermarket cables are recommended.\nwarranty period short for a power supply.",
      "Has not failed me yet.",

      "Perfect PSU, couldn't be happier with it.",

      "good PSU 750 watts is all you need for a system like this ive had people tell me its a ****** PSU based on reddits PSU tier list but ive had no issues with it no melting no plastic smells no BS.",

      "The edge PSU works perfectly with the King 95 Ultra case. I like how the cables are already braded so you don't have to get extension cables to make the build look good.",
      "Pros:\nCables come braided and have combs on them\nL shape design makes plugging in cables a breeze\nComes with a dedicated 12V 2x6 port and cable (the prongs that plug into the GPU and powersupply are bright blue so when you go to install it makes it easy to identify that the plug is all the way in)\nCables come in a nice bag that can be reused to keep spare cables in\nThe wattage options this power supply comes in\nAdds 4 additional ports for USB 2.0 headers to plug into\nCons:\nAvailability (almost always out of stock)\nMainly designed for dual chamber cases (Ex. Lian Li O11 EVO XL)\nMinor Grievances:\n-None\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis is a very nice power supply from Lian Li. I would absolutely recommend this, only if you are building a PC in a dual chamber case (most cases coming out today are). The L shape makes installing and routing cables a breeze and makes cable management much easier. The cables you will normally see in the front of the PC (24 pin, 8 pin PCI-Es, and 12V 2x6) come braided and have combs on them to keep them organized. Comes with a dedicated 12V 2x6 port and cable, along with a two 8 pin PCI-Es to a 12V 2x6. My only issues is that these power supplies are almost always on back order and never in stock. I got lucky and grabbed mine from a restock on Amazon."

I needlessly went with the SFX-L form factor, my mITX H200i case can hold a full size PSU, but that's my doing, not the PSU. As it is, it's very compact yet the fan is very, very quiet. The inclusion of ridiculously short cables is the only thing that lets it down, requiring additional investment in longer / extension cables, on top of an already quite pricey PSU.",
      "I wanted to have something quieter than normal sfx power supplies so I went with sfx-l. This has already worked well for over a year and it has never been loud so great job."

      "I had a bad experience with a corsair PSU a few years back and since then I've only gotten seasonic PSUs for my personal systems and any systems I build for friends and family. This thing has been through ~100+ power cuts and still has no issues whatsoever. It being fully modular is very appreciated for cable management and the fan is super quiet. Highly recommend.",
      "No notes. Hybrid mode is nice. Stock cables are meh but not a big deal for me personally",
      "Pretty efficient and hasn't blown up (yet)",
      "It's Seasonic. What more is there to say?\nPlenty of wattage, plenty efficient, A on the PSU hierarchy, and hasn't blown up. If you can get this for sale on Newegg like I did, it's even cheaper than plenty of much worse options.",
      "Reliable and power. Cables are flexy.",
      "I originally was going to buy a different power supply, but MicroCenter threw this one at me and I just went with it. So far, it's been great. My GPU has hit wattages of 275+ at times thanks to a specific game (Placid Plastic Duck Simulator), and it's handled it flawlessly.",
      "Amazing PSU. It is modular, includes all the cables you´ll need, 80+ Gold, 750W and 10 year warranty on top. But: the price recently went sky-high and I am afraid I wouldn´t pay those prices even though my experience has been pretty much flawless as nothing burned down so far.",
      "Modular. 750w. Does its job.",
      "A very very good supply. For the price I got it for, I am very impressed though if you want a prettier PC, aftermarket cables are nice. The PCIe cables are ugly and unpleasant but overall not too bad. I don't have the budget for aftermarket cables so this did the job absolutely perfect and with the 10 year warranty it perfectly fits my use. Plus 750W gives a little headroom for overclocking. I like it.",
      "It's definitely supplying power right now. All voltages look good. No fires, explosions or ruined parts yet. It's extremely quiet. It has ribbon cables, except for the 24 pin. 10 year warranty. I feel like you can't really go wrong with SeaSonic (or Super Flower)."

      "This PSU is an absolute powerhouse—efficient, quiet, and rock-solid. With 80 Plus Platinum/Titanium efficiency, it delivers clean, stable power to my Ryzen 9 9950X3D & RTX 5090 build without breaking a sweat. The fully modular design makes cable management easy, and its ATX 3.0 & PCIe 5.0 support ensures it's future-proof for high-end GPUs. Plus, with its USB monitoring feature, I can track power usage and efficiency in real time, giving me full control over my system's power consumption.\nEven under heavy loads, the silent fan mode keeps noise levels low, only spinning up when necessary. With a 10-year warranty and premium build quality, this PSU is a set-it-and-forget-it component that provides peace of mind and full visibility into my system’s power performance.",
      "great psu, wont burn up your 5090 (probably) and is silent. i dont even remember one time that the fan has spun. the cables it comes with are WACK though, individually sleeved cables are terrible for cable management. probably a personal preference thing tho",
      "The real reason to buy this is the better quality cables and the need to use less of them. Makes cable management in a tight space so much easier. No one talks about this as a plus when considering Power Supplies.",
      "Solid power supply. Provides enough power for my PC and I've had no issues.",
      "An absolute overkill for my build but that means that I'll never have to worry about adding more power hungry components in the future nor for any noise from the fan. Quite compact as well. One of the best PSU according to Cultists Network.",
      "PSUs are the one thing you can keep reusing repeatedly, so I just went with the best. It came with a nightmare 24-pin connector that barely fit into the x670E-E, so I needed to remove the entire motherboard after installing the CPU AIO. We struggled to shove its cord into the motherboard. Eventually, we got it in but are planning to order a different, flat power cord that will replace this as one of the pins had come bent inside the cord & we needed to straighten one or two for them even to work. I'll be looking into different cords for this.",
      "1300W! My first MSI power supply. Has been rock solid handing my 4090. Cables are very nice. It's a great looking power supply as well if that matters to you.",
      "PSU: MSI Meg 1300Ai\nHow much will you pay for peace of mind? For me, a lot. Shouldn't need to upgrade for years. Cables all looks good and clipped in easily. Time will tell if it was worth the premium.",
      "This PSU got a lot of great reviews. I like to use Seasonic or EVGA brands but couldn't pass up the reviews on this one. Also my choices were limited because I needed a PSU with a 12hvpwr connection for the 4K GPU's, and didn't have the range of choice I usually do.",

You definitely want an SFX (not SFX-L) PSU for the Dan A4-H20, you want that extra space.\nThe PSU is very quite and we weren't able to hear the fan while the system was at full load.",

On my build, the 2x8 PCIe caused alot of pressure on my GPU mount with how much cord is between the 2 ends and with how rigid it is. But if your build has plenty of space, it's a good PSU to have"

The included cables are flat so it's easy to bend and get them to fit however you need.\nHaving the connectors on the side made it easy to swap out 2 regular 8-pin PCIe cables for the 12VHPWR. This also makes building less stressful.\nMy only minor complaint is the connectors on the PSU side are TINY and somewhat close together after you've connected them so you're gonna need a bit of patience to get them back out.",

      "This is a reputable brand and in this case was extremely cheap. Nearly every other brand around this price range is a cheap off brand with nightmarish reviews of PSU failure. Also, it is not a very good idea to skimp out on the PSU, despite it being a budget build I was not going to cut this corner, as much. However, the thought did cross my mind. Sometimes its better to pay the extra money to save possible future headaches. This was one of the rare exceptions. Its non-modular, which makes no difference to me this case will not be opened for a long time, and the aesthetics mean very little . Of course its not modular so that makes cable management a little bit harder, but for the price it went nice with this build."

It's whisper quiet and if for whatever reason you wanted to there's a fan toggle for automatic or always on. Fits in great with my all white PC!",

Attractive white color, ATX 3.1 compatibility including the dreaded 12V cable connection, and more than enough connections for all of your motherboard, GPU and peripheral needs. Includes premium individually shielded wire cables. Make sure to check that you have the version that is built in China and not Japan.",

Sleeved cables that are flexible enough but not individually sleeved. The GPU cable is a pigtail style which I don't like, but I use custom extension cables anyway so not an issue.",

The ATX 3.0 certification means the 850W can safely and reliably handle the power spikes caused by the new RTX graphics cards. I do not expect me using even more power-hungry components in the future, that would require more than 850W combined."

The cables have a braided feel and are much higher quality then most power supply brands, so that a big bonus.\nUPDATE AS OF NOVEMBER 2024: I would unfortunately be unable to recommend this PSU, since recently during an upgrade, it gave off a foul burning odor, so I never used it since.",
      "Looked for white Psu’s and this one seemed like a good option at the time . It still is I would argue and would recommend , but unfortunately (And I added the extra 25$ to the price ) I purchased a Mobo EPS Cable and mounting bracket (Sfk > Atx) , which were the additional costs and headache . Overall not bad , just get something else if thats not for you , unless you want a tiny power house :)",
      "4 months of use and no issues with power delivery. The cables aren't very long, routing them to the PSU required full length in my case, but I got cable extensions to clean the build up.",
      "I actually got the 750 Watt white variant, but that is not available on pc part picker.\nThe 24-pin power cord is very short, which required me to mount it opposite of ideal (fan in) so that it would reach. I'll probably have to go with custom cables at some point.\nI do like that the wires are both white and have white connectors, which not all white PSU's went with.\nThe wires are a nice mix between stiff and flexible.\nSo far so good, quiet, does what it's supposed to, nice sleek clean look with everything white - fan, connectors, wires.",
      "It is a good looking PSU and has a high wattage. Also has enough cables. The braided cables look really good. The only problem is that the PCIe cables are short, they just barely reached my ASUS ROG STRIX 3070, I had to route the cables from above because they don't reach the connecter from underneath. Some cable extensions are recommended if you are using the Lian Li O11D mini (I don't know if they reach in other cases)."

      "Didn’t arrive dead Hasn’t done any weird noises Works so far\nComes with a lot of cables Got it for $100 Comes with some like 600 watt cable for something, if it doesn’t come dead, then I recommend buying it"

      "Awesome idea to have cables route up to add give when managing them. Cables are stiff but bendable and keep shape. Quiet, haven't even heard the fan turn on.",
      "For the cases that can accommodate it, I think the RMx Shift series is a great innovation in consumer PC supplies.\nPros:\nperformance; Cybenetics-certified Gold Efficiency / A Noise rating\nATX 3.1-certified; includes 2x8-pin PCIe->12V-2x6 adapter.\nside-facing cable inputs; facilitates far easier cable access and management compared to the standard PSU layout.\nCorsair Type 5 micro-fit cables; notably more compact connectors than the Type 4 predecessor.\nfluid dynamic bearing fan\n100% Japanese 105 °C capacitors\n10-year manufacturer’s warranty\nCons:\ncost; way over-priced compared to similarly performant 850 W power supplies.\nlimited compatibility; incompatible with dual chamber fish tank-style cases, or any chassis narrower than 210 mm in width.\nlack of native 12VHPWR / 12V-2x6 connector.",
      "The psu was something we worried about a little bit but turned out to be great. The side mounting was also nice and you could sea in the pics how we removed the hdd/ssd pocket to fit the cables in the psu",
      "Little bit over the top, but it gets a job done and it’s quick with it and it’s quiet with the fan",
      "Great design",
      "Works great. Let down by horribly stiff and inflexible cabling that made placement and cable management really challenging."
