      "Hub works fine.",
      "Pros:\nMakes adding sets of Lian Li case fans together an ease\nL Connect 3 software is easy to use\nComes with cables for the fans to plug into this controller. Meaning you no longer need to plug the fans into a separate PWM and ARGB header, reducing total number of cables\nVery easy to setup in the case\nComes with a magnet you can stick to the back of this to mount into your case\nCons:\nRequires you to plug in two SATA power cables to power this and the fans\nRequires plugging in a Micro-USB into the controller, which has a USB 2.0 header on the other end to plug into the mother board\nMinor Grievances:\nThe Micro-USB to USB 2.0 header has to be plugged into the motherboard directly. It would not work with me when trying to plug it into the USB 2.0 ports on the Lian Li EDGE PSU\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis is a must of you are going to have large number of Lian Li fans in your PC case. However, if you are getting some of Lian Li's new \"Wireless\" fans you do not need this controller.",

This one does what it's supposed to do I plugged in my two single frame case fans into it. It was very easy to set up and I could have plugged the fans into my motherboard directly but it's easier to use a controller because you can control all the RGB and fan speeds (RPM) through the NZXT software.",
      "Works just fine but I shouldn't have to buy it",
      "The controller that came with my fans did not have enough hookups so had to buy this. Part of what NZXT does where you pay cheap but you have to buy more. Didn't want to buy this but needed to link up all my fans so was almost forced into it. NZXT CAM is a good software so there is some upside.",
      "Very handy for connecting a bunch of NZXT fans. The controller is magnetic so it sticks to my case ( NZXT H9 Flow ). Be aware if you buy this, any other non NZXT RGB components will need additional RGB software. Running multiple RGB programs can cause issues!",

      "These were more of a necessity purchase for me. I really dislike that I HAD to get these for my fans RGB to work. I also had to get two because there just isn't that many RGB ports on these things. I wish there was some way around it, but for NZXT I just couldn't find one. At least on the bright side all the fans were ARGB and these made them individually work as they should so win some lose some I guess. I just wish the cheaper ARGB solutions weren't so convoluted."

Your motherboard almost certainly won't handle 12 fans daisy chained together, as the power draw for the RGB (and maybe the PWM) will simply be too high.\nThey work great. Only minor complaint is that they take up a lot of space in the back of the case, which made cable routing a bit hard. Otherwise though the fans are running perfectly.\nImportant to note is that the controller has a single red connector in the corner. This is the port that determines the current fan speed. One fan should always be connected there.",

      "This thing looks cool, and if you want to turn your computer into a centerpiece, I'd recommend this thing. If you actually want to use it to control your fans, look somewhere else. The fan headers on your motherboard do a great job at that.\nThis thing does not know how to take full advantage of your fan's capabilities. (I don't think any fan controllers do) So unless you have more fans than you have fan headers, this thing is mostly cosmetic. Even then, you should get splitters for your fan controller, so that they will actually work properly.\nThe first one I got had a broken fan but Best Buy customer service is really great and they got me a replacement quick and easy. The fan also randomly starts beeping rarely -- it has a temperature alarm but apparently it randomly goes off even when disabled. Thankfully it doesn't last very long.\nTl;Dr - Seriously, don't buy this thing. It makes my computer look pretty cool and that's like really the only good thing about it.",

Another problem I seem to be running in to is that it will not let me put any fan over 1100 RPMS. I would like to be able to get them a little higher when the situation calls for it. It puts about 2 fans at 1100 and the other 2 go in and out of 800 to 1000 when they feel like it. I will be browsing around the manual and website to see if there is a fix to this. I like that I am able to change the speeds up to where they are at though. Also love the temp alarm that sounds off if it gets too high.\nI would suggest this to anyone looking to control their fan speeds. It is not the greatest but it is pretty neat. Love the build in clock too."

      "Not the best purchase, the white LED color is way off which is frustrating. I find myself using software to control my fans instead.",

      "This is a great fan controller. Not very fancy compared to a lot of them, but works great and you can hook up several fans to each switch. Has worked for me for 4 years without a single issue.",
      "Controller works well enough, and it looks nice. But unfortunately the view angle is very small. I have to be standing directly in front of it to be able to read the display accurately. There is little in the way of instructions and how to actually work it's functions.",
      "This fan controller is absolutely perfect. 6 channels, RGB lit sliders, and just really simple to use. Has a matt-black finish giving it a super sexy look. Unfortunately, it is no longer manufactured by NZXT. I found mine on ebay for $20, but NZXT does sell certified refurbished for around $35.",
      "for what it is and what it does its very expensive, but it does compliment the case very nice.",
      "Great little fan controller has more than enough connectors for all my fans works as advertised.",
      "Individual control for noise-reduction was much easier with this. Also it has an Orange color setting.",
      "Plenty of fan headers but the cables are very difficult to remove for cable management. I cut myself trying to get one off.",

      "Really liked the look of the display on this controller, I felt it would look good with the build and it would be cool to know the temps of different areas of you pc case. I have only the intake and outtake fans manually controlled, as i would prefer to let the mother board determine the speed of the important stuff. Currently have the thermometer probes set so that i know the temps of the air coming into the front of the case, the bottom of the case, between the GPUs and the air leaving the back exhaust. Not that it's the most accurate way to track your component temps but cool gee wiz knowledge to have. A bit tricky to install as it involves all these small cables and maybe some reorganization but overall I think it looks dope and functions well."

      "Honestly, this was not my first choice of can controllers simply because I wouldn't spend the money and use the full feature set of this controller. However, having said that, this is a beautiful, simple and efficient fan controller to use. The digital display is excellent and minimalist, displays voltage or RPM, which fan is selected, % of selected fans V or RPM, thermisters temp is displayed in the top right per thermistor in C or F. Allows for liquid pumps, and different fans to be controlled automatically by thermistor temp or manually through voltage/RPM speeds. Although it fits well into my 5.25\" drive tray, the short brackets on the controller make it difficult to work with unless it's allowed to hang out the front, on my case there is only 1 screw hole that lines up from my optical drive tray and the controller brackets, so it hangs a bit loose. The screen cover and led monitor are a bit separated on my controller, so I occasionally have to press on the screen to properly illuminate the screen. Otherwise looks beautiful, works well, haven't been able to use thermistors without thermal adhesive/tape, also makes a loud beep on computer boot, but very easy to use.",
      "For Delivering 36 watts per channel and not buckling underneath the wait of my delta fan this thing earns its gold stars.\nthat said I wish the construction on it was a bit more sturdy so that the display doesn't flex so easily, it would also benefit from an extended \"bracket\" for putting it into your 5.25 bay. The screws are annoying to screw into my case due to the fact that they hide behind the lip of where it opens up behind the panel. All in all though its a good piece even with its few quirks"

To put it in perspective, it can control 10 of the infamous Delta AFB1212GHE-CF00fans (29.4W for each) at full speed at the same time (2 per channel). You will probably need just one CF525 for your entire system's cooling requirement, but make sure you put a good quality 700W power supply alongside with this fan controller, and you will need a PCI-Express 8-pin header from the power supply to power the CF525"
