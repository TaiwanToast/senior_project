      "Simple, good looking, nice RGB and really fast.",

      "Bought for 98 USD at Best Buy on January 2025. Wanted non-RGB ram but ended up getting the cheaper option; it's not 6000 CL30, but I wouldn't be able to tell the difference I'm sure. It's ram and it works.",

      "Corsair Vengeance DDR memory kits have been my go to for all of my PC builds except for my first and this is another solid performer. 32 GB capacity, standard heat shields, solid construction, visually attractive and RGB lights controllable via iCUE software at a good price.",
      "I really like the DDR5 version of the Vengeance memory heat spreaders; they have a nice, simplistic look to them, and the RGB looks fantastic. They are usually a little bit cheaper than other mainstream alternatives, such as G.Skill, as well. As for performance, the DDR5-6000 CL36 XMP profile just works.",
      "Good RAM, comes with RGB. However, the latency is slightly higher than some other RAM sticks.",

If you're doing a non-LED build and air cooling your CPU, both sticks of RAM just happened to fit perfectly and discreetly under the Phantom Spirit's fans without having to offset them from the radiators at all! DDR5-6000 CL30 has been said to be the ideal spec for AM5 Ryzen procs so far in 2025, and as I don't really have any other experiences to compare it to, I couldn't really say otherwise. Just be sure to turn on the EXPO profile to enable their full potential.",

So whatever RAM sticks you choose, make sure it matches that spec and always memtest your RAM!\nIf you want to experiment with Buildzoid timings for this RAM, I have linked the most recent one.\nRefer:\nIs High-Speed Memory Worth It For Gaming? Stock vs. EXPO/XMP\nUpdated Buildzoid timings for 2025 - check top highlighted comment by @zugre",

Haven't figured that one out, but the product number is different--CMH32GX5M2N6000Z30. I haven't played around with timings other than just loading the profile, and I probably won't in the future. That said, even with the $10 discount making it $120, it is really overpriced, so I wouldn't buy this in a new build.

It truly is a chonk x2. Recommend measuring first as I did not do this and the clearance wasn't enough, so I had to move my cooler over (rookie mistake).",

      "Kingston FURY Beast RGB 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30 Review: Fast, Stylish, and Affordable\nThe Kingston FURY Beast RGB 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 is an outstanding choice for anyone building a high-performance PC, particularly when paired with a powerful processor like the AMD Ryzen 9800X3D. The speed and responsiveness of this memory are fantastic, offering seamless multitasking and high-bandwidth performance for both gaming and productivity tasks. With its DDR5-6000 speed and CL30 latency, it‚Äôs optimized to get the most out of Ryzen‚Äôs architecture, ensuring smooth and efficient operation across the board.\nAesthetically, the RGB lighting on the FURY Beast is a major highlight. The colors are vibrant and easily customizable, adding a touch of personality to the build. Whether you prefer a subtle glow or a more dynamic, flashy look, the RGB lighting can be tuned to fit your style perfectly.\nWhat really stands out, though, is the value. For 32GB of high-speed DDR5 memory, the price is incredibly competitive, especially given the performance and quality you're getting. In a world where memory prices can vary dramatically, Kingston has delivered a great balance between cost and performance with this kit.\nOverall, the Kingston FURY Beast RGB 32GB DDR5-6000 CL30 provides excellent speed, an eye-catching RGB experience, and great value for anyone looking to maximize the performance of their system without breaking the bank. It‚Äôs a perfect complement to a high-end setup like the Ryzen 9800X3D. Put as 4 stars, as had to install the Kingston RGB software, i couldnt see to control this in OpenRGB although maybe thats a lack of knowledge on my part.",

      "RAM seems completely stable under XMP 3200MhZ, and 32GB for the price is just amazing. I love the aesthetics as well, but keep in mind it may not fit some coolers (as I almost had with my Peerless Assassin 120) as its profile is... not small. That's the only possible downside though; amazing RAM kit!",
      "good ram, don't have any problem, one of the nicer looking kits",
      "Nice.",
      "Cheap RAM without using RGB nonsense. Why not?",
      "Purchased: 2024\nWorks well.\nI purchased this and only 2 sticks as it was on my Motherboard QVL List as working for 4 sticks of it. Thus it maximises stability as I wanted to test XMP again from the previous RAM I used.\nXMP worked well except for one game, being The Division 2 in DX12 mode which would crash on rare occasion. There was no way of knowing that it was XMP causing this without replacing my previous RAM and using trial and error, at the end of the day XMP no matter how stable will never be as good as JEDEC in terms of stability, therefore I always run JEDEC (Default) speeds which is 2400Mhz CL17 with these as it just makes life so much easier.\nTherefore I have the most stable memory I can possibly get for this motherboard, which IMO is important considering how vital RAM is to the constant functioning of the entire PC.... Stability is vitally important and instability can show up in almost any way and impossible to diagnose without trial and error.\nNo RAM test ever found any issues with my XMP settings for both this and previous RAM and yet I can confirm they absolutely do exist.",
      "Always good.",
      "Does ram stuff. Was relatively cheap. Hits advertised speeds. Looks clean.",

      "Good RAM. Lots of access randomly.",
      "I understand computer memory ‚Äî Random Access Memory, or RAM ‚Äî as a digital desk or clipboard: The more space you have, the more things you can have on it simultaneously without needing to open a drawer or walk over to a filing cabinet to get more papers, folders, and books to work on.\nUsually the more RAM you have the better because it means you can run, say, a video game at the same time as a voice chat application like Discord and a streaming application like OBS without having any of these slow any of the others down.\nMemory usually comes in pairs due to computing reasons, and this pair of G.SKILL Ripjaws S5 Series DDR5 RAM 32GB sticks are plenty for Interwebs Communotron 2023 to juggle several tasks like some forgotten runaway prodigy performing in a circus.",
      "XMP works, and better now. I had it disabled for the longest time because of the boot time. Also because the system was unstable with XMP, undervolting, and PBO enabled. DDR5 boot times got better with bios updates as of 2025-01. Edit: Adding another pair of these did not work with MSI B650 GAMING PLUS WIFI ATX AM5 at the time of writing. I should have bought more ram the first time around.",
      "These work with Expo. Installed and trained RAM. No issues. This is what RAM should do. Hits boost frequency. Bought this as it was on the MSI board compatible list as well.",

      "I would only recommend buying this ram kit when it is around the $80-$95 price range, as in my opinion it is more of a budget ram kit compared to others. If this ram kit is priced around $100+ at your time of reading, consider getting RAM from Corsair or Crucial, as they would also be around the $100+ range but will also be a better supported kit for overlocking and such.\nI had issues with overclocking my RAM to the full 6000MHz, but that could just be user error when I'm in the BIOS. Even at 4800MHz, it runs beautifully and I've had no issues other than the overclocking."

I haven't tried to fiddle with voltage yet as I don't know anything about that yet, but I honestly don't know what could be setting it to that amount instead of 3000MHz each and I'm honestly not bothered by the miniscule loss.",
      "EXPO turned on with no issues is the sweet spot for 7000 series and was only 90 pounds at time of purchase 32gb could be considered overkill but apps load quicker and during gaming with discord open it is about 17-18gb of ram usage",

I'm not sure if this is expected, and am curious if anyone else had any luck just using the default EXPO settings.\nEdit2: This specific model of RAM is not on the official AMD \"Overclocked Memory Compatibility List\", so that is likely why I had to customize my settings and the default EXPO did not work.",

      "I'm running DDR5 memory with low CAS latency, and it makes a noticeable difference in both gaming and productivity. Paired with my Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Gigabyte Aorus Pro X870E, the system feels incredibly responsive, with faster load times and smoother performance in CPU-intensive tasks. Enabling EXPO/XMP was simple, and it has been completely stable with no crashes or instability.\nThe low latency really shines in gaming, helping reduce frame dips and improve overall fluidity. Temps stay cool thanks to well-designed heatsinks, and overclocking headroom is solid for fine-tuning. If you're looking for fast, efficient DDR5 with tight timings, this kit has been a great pick for my build."

      "Looks good and runs well.",
      "Corsair Vengeance. Pricey RAM, but you absolutely get what you pay for.",
      "Crashes my PC unless i disable it's RGB (crashes are random and once took a week or so, was not smart... and didn't check motherboard compatibility rip) but yes they work fine otherwise, if they didn't work at all i would of obviously returned them but they magically work, been 7 months now using them :)",
      "This RAM not only looks great with its customizable RGB lighting but also performs exceptionally well. The 64 GB capacity ensures smooth performance in heavy multitasking and rendering tasks.",
      "Went with 6000mhz with a CL30 as it has the best performance with AMD at the moment. Have been using Corsair Vengence Ram for my last 3 builds and haven't had a problem so stayed with them. Wanted white and RGB. Paid $230 off Amazon.",
      "Infinity Fabric in AMD chips favors 6000mhz, going above faces stability issues. CL 30 was the lowest latency I could find for 6000. Corsair makes good ram. No questions best option. Only 4 stars cus they dont have this in EXPO, but XMP and EXPO (as far as Ive seen) have no major performance difference.",
      "Awesome ram. While it may be 6000 mhz which isn‚Äôt the top tier, 64gb is what I was looking for and this takes care of dual channel which is good for ram. Plus it lights up."

      "No complaints. For a 32 GB kit, the price is excellent. The DDR4-3200 CL16 XMP profile just works. The heatsinks have a nice look to them and they‚Äôre relatively low profile, perfect for a white themed PC build."

      "Apart from not being able to enable my XMP profile once I first finished the build, was annoyed with them. Since though I have and it makes a world of difference imo, went from 4800 Mt/s to 6400 Mt/s. And they are gorgeous.",
      "You're getting these for that boujee/clean look and that's what you'll get. Looks way better in person and the color LEDs pop. The price is something you'll have to decide if its worth it or not.",
      "Great looking RAM. As of now no stability issues running at 6400 mhz even with at 7600x."
