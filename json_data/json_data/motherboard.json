      "The functionality of this board seems fine as reported by other reviews. The audio output from the high-quality Realtek 4080 codec seems subtly better than my previous motherboard with its Realtek 897 codec. However, I'm not a fan of how the socket for the JUSB2: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Connector is mounted because it took a lot of force to insert the plug. Also, it seems that by design the plate labeled TOMAHAWK is a little wobbly despite being securely attached... which feels cheap even though I suspect this is inconsequential.",
      "Very good value and the most reviewed motherboard of its gen here. Has everything you need plus more. Apparently, it is now being reported to even have a PCIE 5 support. No problem running RTX 5070 Ti with it. Highly recommended.",
      "At $159.99, this particular board purchased from Newegg felt like a great snag (only $10 over MSI's B650 Gaming Wifi's best price of $149.99). Has a finished IO back panel, not the cheap looking chrome backplate to pop in. The Tomahawk has 3 NVMe slots, 2 with heat covers and this particular board's revision was ready for the Ryzen 9700X out of the box without needing a BIOS update either. Bluetooth and WIFI worked right away once Windows 11 was booted, online and doing updates which was much better experience with this than I had with getting the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX WIFI and Bluetooth working and this one has a BIOS Flash button and decent built-in audio compared to the Aorus. Plenty of various generations of USB slots, too. Wish I had bought this instead for my own build.\n-- Note: if you're building this particular motherboard and the Lancool 207 Case is that the front USB header is struggle to connect to the motherboard, this case has a cable management bracket that is in the worst spot possible for this motherboard connection, but that bracket can be unscrewed and moved while you plug in the USB header cable. Please do not try to plug it in without removing that bracket. Two of us attempted and bent some of the connection pins on the motherboard, which we were thankful able to carefully move back with into place enough to connect the header cable. --",
      "Worked beautifully out of the box with the CPU. Didn't take much BIOS fiddling to get going. Has a metric ton of USB ports and internal fan headers, which is great.",
      "Bought for 180 USD from Newegg in January 2025. Incredibly easy motherboard to work with; BIOS was very easy to flash, I/O panel has tons of ports, MSI Center was helpful as well as well. Looks super clean too, will definitely lean towards MSI motherboards in the future.",
      "Boot time is grossly long and msi rgb mystic light sucks so bad😂",
      "Great Motherboard with Wifi 6E\nPros :\nSupports up to 256GB of RAM\nHas build in Wifi 6E\nMany USB ports\nHas a build in sound card\nHas a build in Bluetooth\nTwo NVME slots\nWorks with many CPUs\nCons :\nI had some issues installing the Wifi drivers for Win 11",
      "Best motherboard option out there, no question.",
      "Pretty dam good, except for the latest bios update that for some reason lets you toggle on CPU gaming mode for the 7800x3d which is obviously not intended, causing issues.",
      "BIOS easy to use, takes no time to update bios and loaded window. The instruction manual are all you needed to install with this mobo. (best if you use the pdf manual file to find the parts you needed)."

      "loving asus' bios more and more, very pro affordable motherboard",
      "Great for the money and has everything I need.",
      "This board does what it needs to do, bios is easy to navigate, has 2 m.2 slots, Wifi is included (although it does need drivers before it works so you'll need an ethernet connection or Wifi dongle beforehand), and decent rear IO. The vrm cooling is a little lack luster though but as long as you have good airflow in your case it should be fine. My only issue with it is that unless it is on sale for less than 100 bucks, than there are far better options to choose from than at it's normal price point.",
      "Just wanted to comment to help anyone else who buys this mobo. It's great value and does a solid job on a budget. The WIFI adapter WILL NOT WORK until you download the wifi driver from the ASUS website. for windows 10, just download the Realtek wifi driver and the adapter will then work as intended.",
      "Asus = quality. This motherboard is reliable",
      "Nice motherboard. Installation was simple and straightforward, especially for a first time builder. BIOS was also simple. No complaints.",
      "Pretty good for the price I think, UEFI bios was very easy to work with while doing some minor tuning (can you tell ive never had the luxury of it before) 4 stars because finding the correct wifi/Bluetooth drivers was kind of annoying, since I had to see all the drivers and just guess which one works (Realtek drivers worked for me). Also wifi good despite that trouble👍\nUpdate 3/04/2025 Coming back to this review after a few months of usage, the Bluetooth can be very unreliable at times. Most times I can connect my headphones just fine, however every so often there's just way too many problems with getting Bluetooth to work correctly. You'd probably be better off getting a separate Bluetooth adapter if you find yourself facing the same issues honestly.\nWifi still good though 👍",
      "It's a good motherboard. The bios is pretty easy to understand. Wish the RGB software was a bit easier to use, but that isn't a big reason to shun it. For some odd reason, my motherboard occasionally won't detect my CPU. I'm not sure if this is a CPU or a Motherboard issue. Regardless, pretty annoying",

      "Great board, lots of headers for fans, argb (if you like that), good vrms, wifi seems especially good, plenty rear i/o, not over the top argb which i like, great bios and lot of features, just a really solid board that has pretty much all you could want. My only gripe is that if using any of the secondary gen 5 m.2 slots, pcie bandwidth drops from x16 to x8, which, for me, is its only let down. Bios updating couldn't be easier and the primary m.2 heatsink performs very well with my crucial t700 gen5 nvme keeping it around 40c.",
      "This motherboard is defective because the B1 and B2 DIMM slots do not work.

      "Jumping from a B550M to this was great. Loved building with this board, made everything streamlined",
      "Great board. I like the layout better than the last few builds I've done. The quick-latch system for the me.2 slots makes installation a breeze.\nMy only complaint is that there is no valid drivers for the on-board wifi for Win10. Not a problem if you're wired or going right to Win11, but frustrating to deal with if you aren't expecting it.",
      "+newest BIOS update (Dec 2024) is very stable,\n+like the error code display (it saved me a lot of stress, because I had no idea that AM5 needs so long to train RAM at the first boot so I thought the PC was broken at first, but searching the codes showed me it was just training...)\n+legit almost 0 screws during setup, because it has quick latch for SSDs\n+quick release button for GPU (very handy)\n-the 3 SSD slots under the main SSD shroud can be quite annoying, as only the middle one does not reduce PCIe-speeds (if i didnt read the complete manual while bored I wouldve not known)",

      "For the motherboard, I went with the X870 TOMAHAWK. Probably overkill, but it has everything I need, and I have always thought that the TOMAHAWK motherboard series was good.",
      "A little expensive even after the $30 Steam credit. Overall very good board. The post code display location is good. I don't need the full 40G USB-C port, so I installed a Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4 TB to utilize the PCIE 5.0 X2 NVME slot #2.",
      "The CMOS battery is located under the chipset heatsink, meaning you have to remove the board from your case to be able to remove the battery for troubleshooting, which is dumb. The BIOS is easy to navigate, but there are known stability and USB issues with this generation. I got it on sale, but at this point I would recommend a different board if buying again.",
      "Aside from some bugs in the latest version of the bios, this motherboard is perfect. Plenty of headroom for upgrades, sleek looking, and runs my RAM very fast with no issues.",
      "It runs RAM fast and has a whole load of features, but I only seriously considered it due to large promo discounts and before quality control seemed to be decreased on MSI AM5 boards",
      "My first time seeing a PCIE release button (I now know its been done before) and it actually blew my mind. Great looking with great features.",
      "Sturdy motherboard, plenty of plugins, BIOS came on a chip with the motherboard, but it was already preinstalled, RAM slots were great and easy to put the RAM into, the CPU slot was easy to install the AMD bracket onto, and it gave me no problem installing the CPU. Great fastening to the case, love the error code reader.\nThis is a great motherboard choice. I was hoping to get one that had some sort of RGB, but to be honest, this motherboard just doesn't need it, it is performance over appearance with this thing. It has two SSD slots, one has a heat sink and is where I put my primary SSD. The other one doesn't have a heat sink but I intend to put another SSD in at some point. It has four ram slots, two pins on either side, making it easy to install. Installing my AIO with the AMD bracket went very smoothly no issues there. Setting the CPU down no problem, everything was good. All the plugins on the back provide great options to plug into, USB 3.2 and 3.0, I had an option for a fiber optic cable which I used for my Astro Mix AMP. All the connections on the motherboard, like power, front panel connectors, USB, CPU fan, pump control connector all were labeled and were easy to plug into. Also there were a lot of fastening screws for this motherboard to the inside of my case and knowing I was going to have a heavy graphics card made me feel a lot better. Also, the error code at the top right of the motherboard will tell you what's wrong with your computer if there are issues even during booting. It is a very nice touch on the motherboard, the motherboard will tell me whether it's the graphics card, CPU, boot, or DRAM. The Ethernet port on the back is a little faster than most other motherboards out there on the market. This thing was 100% percent worth the money and I probably would have paid more money for something this good.",
      "I have been happy with the performance so far at first I wasn't happy with the green accents but with RGB on you barely notice it.",
      "This motherboard fails to boot after enabling EXPO with several CORSAIR RAM kits. Not sure who’s to blame — AMD, MSI, or CORSAIR.",
      "Definitely one of the better choices for ATX X870 motherboards out there. Not running any Gen5 NVMe SSDs yet to take full advantage of it, but definitely will in the future. Also has a nice dark grey color which works well with the rest of the build. One major gripe I did have though is a lack of a decent location for a rear fan header. The X670E version has it near the rear fans like most other boards, but to run cabling for the rear fans on this you have to pick one of the headers on the top or bottom sides which is quite annoying."

      "Such an amazing motherboard to build on. No problems with CPU, RAM and SSD installation. Also features a WiFi option. Heatsinks aren't bad at all and VRMs are proving my 7600X wrong. Fantastic overall and the bios wasn't much of a fuss.",
      "Good looking mother board, cheap, good features.",
      "Cheapest ATX AM5 mobo that had all the features I wanted at the time, no complaints other than the Bluetooth which I cant get to work, I wont bump it down a star because that seems to just be a me problem.\nAlso my front panel usb-c isn't getting any power and I heard its a gigabyte mobo issue (because you can't flip the header) so be aware.",
      "Yep, this one's a good one; no problems at all.",
      "Nice motherboard, I heard a lot of people complain about having to download wifi drivers and all, which wasn’t the case with mine although I flashed the bios before building my pc, which may have also installed wifi drivers. But great board with more than enough connectivity",
      "This has to be possibly the best budget b650 mobo available. The bios is great to work with, the connectivity is amazing and the gigabyte control center app is the best thing about it all which is basically all u need for drivers, rgb, fan control etc.",

Only thing I'm a bit split on is the USB 3.0 wire. Can't tell if I like it how it is or the more traditional way. But beyond that, very good board.",

      "This motherboard comes with WiFi and Bluetooth, but without any extra features, which is perfectly okay since I care more about performance than looks for my setup. I'm using an Ethernet connection, but having WiFi and Bluetooth is a nice backup if I need to transfer files or if my Ethernet cable needs to be swapped out.",
      "flash bios button, pcie-gen4, M.2 cooler included, Has 2 m.2 slots, 4 ram slots.",
      "Perfect AM4 mobo. No notes.",
      "Sleek-looking board with a good amount of features. Would be nice to have USB-C on the back IO, but that's really a nit-pick.",
      "nvme slots are backwards, would recommend running Ethernet, and it has a grudge with leaving my keyboard/mouse plugged in, but it's otherwise great",
      "Honestly very surprised by this mobo. Looks truly can be deceiving.\nHas lots of features and connections with wi-fi and bluetooth included for a good price! Worked perfectly with the Ryzen 7 5700X3D. A small but mighty piece of tech. I just don't like the MSI BIOS interface that much but that's up to each personal taste - it gets the job done just fine.\nI had one small issue with it though. The pc wouldn't boot up when I first built it - no lights, nothing. Checked everything and tried to update the BIOS via its USB port with no luck. I managed to \"fix it\" taking the CMOS battery off to clear the BIOS - AND it was surprisingly hard to do so because this mobo came with a plastic lock of some sort on the battery and I couldn't for the life of me get it off. It was the only way I could clear the BIOS as shorting the jumper was doing nothing. I still don't know why this happened, if it was some kind of BIOS corruption due to the retailer updating it or something. It's working perfectly now though!",
      "Updating the BIOS was easy, but the BIOS is a little clunky when designating the boot up drive & adjusting RAM addition. Grabbed it from this seller",

      "Great looking silver motherboard. Decent set of features. SSD slot and PCIE lane sharing only sore point for me.\nWanted it for the silver contrast in the black case.",
      "This MB is definitely on the pricier end, but very satisfied with it.\nThe radiators are well designed, high quality material used throughout, 4x NVME slots, etc.\nOnly \"issue\" so far (as I've come to learn is common) is the onboard screen for errors states \"D8\" or \"08\" which apparently is completely harmless.\nThe \"GIGABYTE Control Center (GCC)\" that automatically pops-up on first boot is quite useful, although you have to be careful about not downloading some of the add-ons like the anti-malware software. Also the software is very inconsistent at controlling the system's RGB; probably better off using SignalRGB.",
      "Looks great, pretty easy to navigate UEFI, and dual USB 4 is a nice add-on. Can't ask for much but a slightly better value proposition.",
      "I was nervous buying a Gigabyte motherboard, in the past they have been very hit or miss in their quality and reliability. But for now it's working well. The board feels very premium, and it better for the price tag I paid for it! It has some nice features for sure. I quite like the latching mechanisms for the NVME M.2 slots and heatsinks, and I like the easy access PCIe latching mechanism. It was overall very nice to build with, no complaints at all.",
      "No issues.",
      "Super cool and lots of options on the board. Wi-Fi is amazing.",
      "I love the board features. Important for Bluetooth. If you use Ethernet only and still want to use Bluetooth you need to install the WLAN antenna which attaches magnetically to the case. It provides signal for Bluetooth too. Otherwise the Bluetooth signal is unworkable. If you want to disable WLAN or Bluetooth-LAN you can still do that in the Windows advanced network settings.",

If you don’t have an optical drive, then have an another computer with an internet connection and usb flash drive nearby to download BIOS and drivers for installation. I had to install WAN drivers in order to use the wifi during Windows installation.\nThe website-linked instructional video was very helpful for flashing the BIOS. Although they said you needed an 8 GB flash drive to flash the BIOS, I got by with what was essentially a 2 GB flash drive (it was actually a microSD card in a USB adapter).\nThe thing that threw me off was that the IO shield was already attached to the board and I assumed had to be left on during installation.

      "I did not want to buy an expensive motherboard so I chose this. I did not know if this would work for me but it is actually pretty good. Easy to build with and no problems at all.",
      "I had issues with this board. I'm not sure what caused it but all of the non-CPU USB 3.0 ports on my motherboard stopped working. I was able to fix it by clearing the BIOS. Other than this issue, this board has been pretty good.",
      "Seems solid, no Wifi 7 if that matters to you. It also doesnt have PCI-E 5.0 for the SSD or GPU, which doesn't matter to me for the drive and still doesn't really matter for even the 5090 from what I've read online. Could become an issue for the next generation though.",
      "Great bord but doesn't have a build in io shield whish was stressful to pit on as a first time builder.",
      "Good Mother Board did not like that the CMOS battery had a little stopper but other than that easy assembly.",
      "When I was setting it up it would not connect to the internet so I could update windows. I had to move my whole pc downstairs to plug it into ethernet just to update windows and get wifi drivers. I only gave it three stars because of the good price.",
      "Doesn't seem to be compatible with openRGB, otherwise everything works perfectly",
      "This motherboard and the Ryzen 5 7600x are a match made in heaven. This MSI motherboard is perfect for my build.",
      "Made building a breeze even if it was my first time building and cable managing. The location of the USB-C port on the motherboard is right between the two rubber grommets on the Montech 903 Base so I had to choose between the two, but didn't cause any issues. Wish it had a paper copy of the instruction rather than trying to refer back to my phone over and over. Very small nitpick, but the website should allow you to download the instructions in one language, that way I don't have an extra 60 pages to go through.",
      "Cheapest and perfect.\nWas a little worried at first when ordering this since I wasn't sure if it would have enough rgb fan headers or usb ports but with everything I used I had no problems at all. Could easily attach 5 of my fans to each rgb header (yes I checked voltages etc first) and it even had a usb-c header which was a nice surprise since I didn't think it had one. I used pretty much every header on this but that for me is perfect since I didn't pay for anything I didn't need. For anyone needing multiple ssd slots or a lot of certain dockers you may want a different mobo but this will work fine for a lot I'm sure"

      "Only 1 nvme slot???? I just assumed it had 2 which is my fault lol. Bios was fine. Bit annoying how this motherboard had 2 headers that looked identical to the front panel io header which meant I couldn't figure out why the computer wouldn't turn on to begin with lmao, make sure to always read the manual. I suppose I'm mainly rating this thing 3 stars due to my own incompetence lol. Although I'd like to add that there are better options (I think) than this like that gigabyte b550 motherboard",
      "Decent board. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles as a more expensive one could get you, but hey, it's a budget board.\nWarning though, as this board DOES NOT come with ARGB headers but JRGB headers.",
      "Nice budget ATX motherboard.",
      "if only the bottom red lights that say \"GAMING\" could change color",
      "I’m going to have to buy an rgb hub because there was no where to plug my fans in, they work just no rgb. This is not the end of the world. The board is a bit ugly and there’s no cover for the storage however it works well and is a good price.",
      "BIOS is easy to use and building it was nice. It doesn't have ARGB (aka JRAINBOW) headers, so you'll need an RGB controller for that. It's definitely a cheaper board, but it's still great.",

Plenty of M.2 slots, and easy to connect to the Bluetooth with this one (I was using a USB adapter with my previous motherboard, so it's nice to have another free USB slot now too).",
      "Worked out of the box (no need for a BIOS update) and drivers were simple to install; only qualm I have is that I had to bring out my old wifi dongle to install said drivers, but a USB drive would've done that just as well in a pinch. Would be nice if I could see its RGB lights around my giant GPU, but I hadn't even known this thing had lights when I bought it, so I don't really mind.",

It supports AM5 processors and DDR5 memory, catering to both gaming and productivity needs. Notable features include Wi-Fi 6, 2.5G LAN, multiple M.2 slots (its toolless), and ample fan headers for cooling solutions. It's a good board, but it's not priced right, so try to get it on sale if you can."

      "Great high end motherboard, got for 100 bucks off of woot. The BIOS flashback feature was super helpful and RGB looks nice",
      "This motherboard has not been anything but a BEAST! I do NOT regret buying it, Kinda, I wanted to go with the ASUS ROG STRIX B550-A Verison that is in white for the Aesthetics Sake. But it was way more expensive then, Now it is cheaper by a few dollars. But otherwise this motherboard is really good!",
      "Amazing looking mobo I would've bought the white version but that doesn't come with WIFI",
      "Rgb looks good and it offers everything i wanted in a mobo except a USB-C port...",
      "This gives power to the space heater and holds it in place, connects with other things.",
      "The motherboard had to have Wi-Fi because we only have 1 ethernet connection on our router and there's 2 of us. Also, I wanted it to be ATX since I figured it would be easier to build a bigger PC than a smaller one. The covers for the M.2 slots were a little confusing and we put them on the wrong way after putting the SSD in, but I figured it out when I was screwing the motherboard into the case because the cover was blocking one of the holes. Also, the manual was very clear and had nice diagrams.",
      "Great mother board, both visually appealing and having a easy to navigate BIOs. Would knock off a star due to it not having a USB C front panel connecter on the mobo, so now the USB C on my front panel is useless and there for show but my fault for not reading the specs before hand.",
      "A bit of a chunk with all the huge heatsinks, but has plenty of connectors and looks very nice, especially the RGB Republic Of Gamers logo. Have to turn off my power supply to turn off the RGB though (I figured it out, read edit). Comes with so many USB (plus other misc.) ports and bios flashback. Included wireless receiver driver didn’t work on the first try but I got it working. Edit: To force your motherboard RGB to turn off when you turn off your PC, go into the bios, then follow these steps: 1. Go to the advanced section 2. Click on APM Configuration 3. On the drop-down bar labeled ErP Ready, enable either S5 or S4 + S5.\nThe difference between the two is S5 still provides power to the motherboard’s USB ports after you turn off your PC (for charging devices and such), while S4 + S5 doesn’t provide power to those USBs after shutdown.\nUpdate: Runs 64 GB of RAM at 4000 speed with no problems!",
      "It’s a nice looking and good motherboard but I don’t like the messy armoury crate software and the rgb header doesn’t stay the colour I want it to for some reason.",

      "It is an excellent value board. I game with a Ryzen 3600 on this frequently and the board has had no issues. RAM XMP worked instantly. Biggest complaint is the sata port locations which will get blocked by the GPU, so each time you want to add another SSD, you have to remove the GPU first and reinstall it. Also, I see no way to fit another PCI device like a wifi card with my 3080 installed.",

Make sure to turn on the monitor before you turn on the pc for the first time, or it will show a vga light. Has quite a bit resistance to force though.",
      "The manual was absolutely useless and the USB connector is sideways, which makes it really hard to route the cable to it without putting a ton of stress on the board. Other than that, it's been working great and I have no complaints from actual use. I got a great deal on it through a Microcenter bundle so for what I paid, I'm happy.",
      "Everyone hates this motherboard model, not quite sure why. It packs some seriously luxurious features for it's low price of $160 when I bought it. The BIOS menu is simple though it was difficult figuring out what my storage devices were since they don't show up anywhere in the BIOS menu for some reason. Not any game-changing complaints though, it's aesthetically pleasing as well.",
      "Great board with plenty of IO and supports 7000 series out of the box. My only gripe is that the front panel USB header is sideways, making it extremely difficult to plug in and line up. I was unable to do it, but I don't use the front panel USB anyway. Other than that, it is great for the price I got it secondhand ($99)"

      "Shockingly good little board, 2 2280 NVMe Slots (PCIe 4 & 3) and great compatibility with the newest AM4 CPUs without requiring a BIOS update. I have to dock a star for the lack of Bluetooth and onboard WiFi though.",
      "Fine motherboard but a huge L for not including any papers to help",
      "This is a nice small form factor mobo. My only issue was that it only had one USB2.0 header. Since I was using a wifi and bluetooth card that needed a USB2.0 header, I needed to leave the case’s USB2.0 connector unconnected. Other than that It was easy to work with.",
      "It's a cheap board that gets the job done. Unfortunately it has auto-download of some Gigabyte software enabled by default in the BIOS, and I don't care if every motherboard manufacturer does it, that doesn't make it okay. The M.2 slots are very annoying to screw in, because there are no screws; instead it's a plastic hook that pops out, and getting the angle to pop it out is very difficult. The board flexed a lot when installing RAM and plugging in power cables.",
      "First, my PC would randomly shut down or restart itself after 30-40 minutes of gaming. It was somewhat fixed after I installed chipset drivers. Then it started freezing when I'm playing Cyberpunk. Also my PC wouldn't enter sleep mode or wake up properly. All of these problems are gone when I use different motherboards (MSI B450M-A Pro Max II and ASUS B550M-K). Conclusion: Stay away from Gigabyte at all costs.",
      "I personally would never ever buy it again, BIOS is confusing and doesn’t have good options, Ram slots are fragile, and it did not come with hardware needed, and was shipped without ANY antistatic bag\nWas this a used board?\nTLDR No AM4 Bracket No antistatic bag Ram clips are fragile BIOS was ok at best",
      "Decent motherboard, doesn't come with wi-fi but that's fine!",
      "Good price nice features, but only one fan header",
      "Decently nice motherboard, though wishing it had wi-fi. It is honestly really good and I recommend it.",
      "For the price this is an excellent little board. You get two M.2 slots and just enough other I/O to make it very capable for a micro ATX board. I'd like it if you got more fan headers, but I literally paid $85 for this board so I'm not going to complain."

It’s BIOS is easy to use and full of options, it’s designed to look nice, and good driver support are the many good things about this mobo. It’s wifi suffices for the cost. Overall this is a great choice for budget AM5 builds."

      "Best budget option board in it's price point that to fit the white theme.\nI got it because it was a great price and it comes with WiFi. I took advantage of the additional NVME slots for a dedicated boot drive and dedicated drive to hold all my steam games. Still one slot available if I want to add more storage space in the future.\nBIOS flashback was easy to do to get my 9 series CPU to work with it.\nOnly downside was that it could use a better LED diagnostic for troubleshooting. I had a difficult time deciphering the LED codes to get my build to POST. But having something is still better than nothing especially at this price point.",
      "Perfectly fine budget motherboard. One of the cable guides came loose when I unplugged the front USB IO cable it was holding, but putting it back was easy enough. BIOS is functional, rear IO has plenty of USB, right angle SATA ports were nice. Only notable issue is that audio from USB speakers would occasionally make a popping noise, but it is rare and quiet enough to eventually tune out. I'm not sure if it is a driver or hardware issue.",
      "Solid Motherboard with pretty good performance not much else to say. Only thing to mention though is 1 or 2 of the standoffs are slightly difficult to get to when your build is in the case. Wasn't much of an issue just took slightly longer to build (maybe an extra 10 minutes) but I guess worth mentioning. That shouldn't push you away from it really the price for what you are getting is pretty much unmatched for mATX.",
      "Straightforward BIOS & installation and its manual was easy to read and navigate. Lots of ports and includes USB-C.\nIf it matters to anybody, the included Wi-Fi card has 2 small thread-like cables that travel up and into the motherboard's I/O heatsink and is slightly visible.",
      "Despite this being near one the least expensive B650 motherboards in Canada, it still provides almost all of the features you would ever need. It has plenty of fan headers, included Wi-Fi 6E, which works great, 2 USB 2.0, 3 USB 3.2 gen1, with one of them being USB type-C and 3 M.2 slots with one of them being PCIe gen5 x4. It also has plenty of ports on the back, including bios flashback and USB type C. Furthermore, it boots extremely quickly, usually under 12 seconds with an easy BIOS to navigate. The manual that comes in-box very good, being the same as one they provide online with very good diagrams. All while being one of the best looking motherboards. The only downside is no support for front panel USB 3.2 gen2 type-A or C at 10 gbps.",

      "Great motherboard. It is a mATX sized one though so keep that in mind. I have no issue with it in my regular ATX sized case but some people are picky about that. If you are buying a new mobo, just get the owner that includes WiFi. It’s worth it. WiFi is wonderful with this one.",

      "For i3 12100 without future upgrades I suggest to buy MB based on H610 chipset unless you can get a similar priced B760 motherboard. I got this MSI Pro H610m-G motherboard for ~ £60- during Black Friday and it is definitely worth this money. This is the best MSI H610 motherboard, which has an aRGB 5V 3-pin connector, M2 Key E WiFi slot but only one 4-pin SysFan connector. Please note that MSI Pro H610m-E is similar but has no aRGB connector, no M2 WiFi slot and no display port but has two SysFan connectors instead and is usually slightly cheaper. I would suggest to check the manufacture website before buying any of them.",
      "Pretty good just only 1 case fan header. Had to use a splitter but no big deal. Removed the Intel stock limiter in bios and aftermarket cooler which made my 12400f to perform at peak performance, scored a little over 12k on Cinebench and single thread 1700.",
      "Cheapest motherboard I could find at the time, but it does have a few limitations. It only has 2 fan headers so fan splitters are a must. Only two DIMM slots for the ram, however I've heard that double channel will run quicker than quad channel. Rear IO plate was Hell to get on",
      "Great entry level budget board. Drivers auto-install on first startup, which was a nice surprise. Only CPU and 1 Sys_Fan header, but they do have a good 2amp output, so plan your fan splitters or hubs accordingly if you want to use direct board PWM control. Just one USB3 header, so if you have a Gen3.1/3.2, get adapters. Nice to have the M.2 E-Key for wifi. No complaints, using it in a HTPC after getting it from MSI in a deal with a free 500w 80+ bronze non-modular psu.",
      "MSI had this bundled with two SSDs and a power supply all for $75! Sure its not the best board but it does what I need and it seems to have absolutely no issues with the CPU or ram compatibility. I will be getting a z series board as an upgrade down the line to take advantage of the k series CPU but for now it works.",
      "The cheapest mobo I could find, it's alright, does what any motherboard should do. It does have only one M.2 NVME slot, so if you are planning to get this and plan to upgrade your storage, then you will have to switch out your existing and replace, or use HDD or SATA SSD's."

      "One of the few AM4 motherboards I could find that had 8 sata ports and two m.2 slots. For the type of build I knew this was going to be I knew I'd need tons of sata ports, and I didn't want to waste a pci slot on an add-in card.\nNot the best vrms, especially for a 5950X. When I initially ran this setup, the cpu was clocking to its default limits, which was 5 Ghz single core and 4.3Ghz all-core (yeah, specs say less, but that's how it was running). Once I limited the cpu frequency to 4.5 and undervolted (-20 in Curve Optimizer), everything ran faster, from boot times to launching desktop apps and even processing shaders for gaming. Definitely feel like with default clocks something in the power-delivery was overheating, causing uneven performance. Call it a hunch.\nOnly other complaint I have is that USB audio needs to be re-plugged after every system boot, or audio plays at a constant maximum volume. Could be a Windows bug so not blaming the motherboard. Am considering adding a sound card anyway (as I listen to a lot of classical and want the best sonic quality possible). Always envisioned this as a possibility, which is another reason I didn't want to add a sata expansion card in the only remaining pci slot.",
      "Great Motherboard For the 99$ I got it for at the time, the Only complaint I have is the lack of ARGB headers.",
      "Haven't had any issues with this board so far. Checks every box for my needs and has a fairly new Wi-Fi card. Had to flash the bios, but it was suprisinglyt only 1 update behind. Also, FYI, if you have an NVME SSD in the second M.2 slot (in the bottom right of the board), 4 of the 8 available SATA ports will be disabled. Took me 30 minutes to figure that out lol.",
      "I've used this motherboard on three builds now. Solid budget option.",
      "Issues: BIOS is a little minimal, not a fan of the IO shield, and a bit slow to boot. Aside from that it's a solid AM4 motherboard. No frills, just function.",
      "Good budget board for the price I figured. Was easy to flash the bios for the 5700x3d. Don’t forget to do that before installing the CPU and cooler like I did. BIOS UI is decent to use. I liked the visual representation of the board that showed what’s installed. Helped me realize the ssd got dislodged from its socket when I was swapping the gpu.",
      "Probably not the best motherboard for the components I have, but it has a charm to it. Runs fine, never had an issue.",
      "Maybe I got a faulty board, but there's no sound coming from it. Which is fine because i got it for around $100",
      "I don't know much about MOBOs but this thing was easy to install and has all of the features I need. Price is fine, probably.",
      "This is a great board that checks most of the boxes that I'm sure not just I look for. Plenty of fan plugs, multiple RGB support WITH ARGB Syncing, Wifi 6E, EZ Debug LED... So much to list. I haven't built a PC since 2007, and this was so nice to have since its easy to install and easy to look at too! Looks awesome in a black case with LED ARGB around it! Only complaint is the Bios isn't as new user friendly as i think it could be, maybe i just need to learn more about it though! Not sure but not taking a star for it."

      "Very nice mobo with no lane sharing with the M.2 slots and the PCIE x16. The SSD heatsink is very nice too.",
      "Super easy installation and such a beautiful motherboard.",
      "Pros: Looks great Gigabyte does not upcharge for white components VRMs are good Toolless M.2 installation and heatsink covers all M.2 slots Cheaper than other brands \"flagship\" boards\nCons: GCC is terrible GCC tries installing Norton (borderline malware) Only 3 3pin RGB headers (relatively standard, still annoying) Without rebates or sales still a relatively pricey board that doesn't offer anything especially special\nWorth knowing: PCIeX16 slot very high up on the board, possible it could be blocked by extremely large air coolers or RAM heat spreaders (GPU nearly touches my RAM) USB header connector faces sideways, generally a good thing for cable management and less cable bend, depending on the case could cause problems",
      "No issues whatsoever so far. Beautiful white MoBo and the GPU release switch is a nice touch. Haven't used the internal HDMI port yet, but I imagine it would work very easily if I wanted to put another screen in the case somewhere.",
      "The Gigabyte B850 Aorus Elite WiFi7 ICE ATX looks amazing especially in a white/light silver theme! It has tons of USB ports on the back I/O, BIOS flashback, and enough USB and ARGC headers to cover my needs. It has a quick release button to help get the GPU out easier. There is also a quick latch for the M.2 drives heatsink that accommodates 3 M.2 drives. You also don't need M.2 screws for the drives as there are latches that keep them in place. The BIOS is simple and easy to find what you need. I had no issues enabling XMP/EXPO to set a profile to for 6000 MT/s speeds. This is my first time using the Gigabyte Control Center software. So far I like it a lot better than Asus Armory crate. The app is a LOT less busy looking compared to Armory Crate and it's very easy to use for controlling fan curves and RBG lightning. Although I wish there were more lighting mode options. It's very limited but that is pretty common with motherboard RGB software I've used over the years.",

      "Looked into a number of mobas. Changed my mind a number of times but always went back to this ROG strix B650E-F. This board fits the theme I was going for. Has all the features I was looking for. Read some reviews that said it has a long boot up time, but for me my PC boots insanely fast! I paired this moba with a Ryzen 7 9700X so I knew a BIOS update was needed for the Zen 5 chip to work. I downloaded the version I wanted from the Asus website and flashed the BIOS before the initial boot up. So make sure you flash the BIOS with a version that has the ability to use Zen 5 chips or you might not POST. BIOS screen is easy to navigate. Still early in use but all in all I am really pleased with choosing this moba.",
      "Amazing motherboard. All I have to say.",
      "I know Asus has quite a dire reputation now, and I personally don't trust any manufacturers on principle. But just going on a case by case basis, this is a great mobo model. The BIOS flashback feature is super convenient, plenty of ports, built in M.2 heatsinks, and good spacing/amount of various headers. Some unobtrusive RGB effects on the side of the board make it feel pretty primo without being Too Much.\nHowever I must agree with other reviewers in that the Asus software is absolute ***. I do not interact with it enough to dock a star from this board, but be warned - it does in fact suck.",

Note: will require bios update in order to use 7800x3d and other Ryzen 7000 series chips. 3 m.2 slots and overall a quality board for the price. I would get this if you are looking for a decently high end motherboard without breaking the bank. Will do everything you could possibly need. I recommend purchasing this up if you are not willing to spend X870E prices and do not mind bios updates.",

      "Motherboard that does motherboard things well, but kind of bummed the headers make it difficult to mount fans for oversized cooling units. It's really my fault for not thoroughly researching though",
      "Fairly easy to build with, does everything I want at a cheaper price point compared to other ITX boards. As one other review noted, beware buying from Amazon (Amazon Canada at least). I received one that was shipped without any extra packaging (just the mobo box you'd get from shopping in-person) and arrived damaged. Tried reordering/refunding, but it didn't ship after 3 weeks despite opting for expedited shipping. Ultimately cancelled and ordered via Newegg Canada.",
      "Kind of pricey, but one of the cheaper options you have for SFF MoBos.",
      "My primary requirements were having a decent amount of USB ports (and at least 1 USB-C header for the front), Wi-Fi 6, 2.5GbE, and Bluetooth. Pricing led me to ASRock and thanks to mITX, it simplified my choices among the B650E, A620I and B650I. The amount of USB ports and maturity of M.2 narrowed things down between the B650E and B650I. In the end, I decided against PCIe 5 graphics and allocated the budget bandwidth to the GPU.",
      "Great value board. Has many of the features that much more expensive ITX boards have for a pretty big discount. Has a couple quirks. It took me way too long to learn that there was a built-in 75C limit for CPUs. Thankfully this is fixable by raising the PTTL. BIOS is somewhat difficult to navigate. Onboard audio is mediocre, got better results with a USB DAC. Otherwise this board looks nice and works fine. No coil whine to speak of.\nEdit: After a couple days of very mild memory overclocking, this motherboard has somehow failed. It can't run RAM past default JEDEC speeds anymore. Planning on testing it with other parts but I'm not hopeful.\nEdit 2: It turns out there is a bug with the BIOS and something to do with Memory Training Runtime Reduction. If you plan on doing any memory overclocking with this board, make sure to manually disable this setting.",
      "most value am5 itx motherboard, no coil whine noticed",
      "I generally believe asrock customer service to be poor but decided to take a risk for the value I found this board at. The board has performed perfectly and is very solid built. I don't believe the onboard audio to be that great.",
      "Very fast boot times and easy to use bios.",
      "The motherboard offers all the necessary features for a compact, high-performance build, including PCIe 4.0 support and built-in WiFi, which is a huge plus for a Mini ITX setup. The layout is well-designed, making it easy to manage cables and fit everything into a small case.\nHowever, I did encounter some coil whine, which was quite annoying. This high-pitched noise was noticeable, and it was disappointing for a build aimed at being as quiet as possible. Fortunately, I found a workaround using the OpenRGB program. Running OpenRGB in the background somehow managed to eliminate the coil whine completely, which was a huge relief.\nAnother downside is the boot time—it takes a bit longer to start up. While not a dealbreaker, it’s something to be aware of if you’re used to faster boot times.\nOverall, the ASRock B650I Lightning WiFi is a solid choice for a Mini ITX build, but the coil whine and longer boot time are drawbacks to consider.",
      "Good io, good thermals, at time of purchase easily the best value AM5 itx 650 board. Sensible layout. Slight gripe with chassis fan header seemingly inoperable, but yet to diagnose this fully."

I'd go for an higher tier and also avoid asrock with the issue its having with 9800x3d CPU's; its unknown to me if the sff has the CPU bricking capability issue due to way lower volume sold. The bios offers voltage offset, and has bios updates that needs to be updated to support 9800x3d. Cheap and decent, but not for overclocking or running high voltage.",

Great for reducing thermals and noise at no cost to performance.",

They got nowhere and told me there was something wrong with the board and send it back.\nI sent it back, absolutely pristine and undamaged. Normally I get a refund immediately when dropping off at UPS, but it took them an additional 9 days to refund, and they charged a $72 restocking fee. I feel like I've been mugged. Never again MSI.",

I updated bios first thing on principle but would have been fine out of the box for the 9800x3d. Installation was a breeze with no hiccups.

      "Good build quality, things are clearly labeled, easy to build on, and great aesthetic. Looks clean in a all white build. Bios is well put together and easy to navigate and work.",
      "All white-clean X870e board with PCIE Gen 5 support. Even the SATA cables are all white 👍",
      "Was originally going to use the NZXT N7 White B650E but they spent two months delaying the shipment so I substituted it for this. I don't regret it at all because this motherboard is a beast as far as utilities go and is worth every penny. But, it does have some shortcomings as far as assembly goes. Has a lot of proprietary mechanical gimmicks that will really throw you off guard compared to any previous gen motherboard.\nWe want screws!!! Taking a point off because this latch and click system they think is hot **** is actually annoying and cheap garbage. I WANT to screw my heat sink in! The videos on Gigabyte's website made no sense at all to me, and I can admit in fairness maybe I just didn't follow it right. But, still, something like this should be the least of my concerns during a build. I know how to install an M2 drive, don't make me feel stupid while doing so. Couldn't believe it became such a nasty bump in the road. Needed help from a friend to get it fixed.\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that the manual is absolutely useless. Luckily we have the internet otherwise this mobo would be a dud. They have videos on Gigabyte's website showing the installation process but it still doesn't explain it well.\nAlso, the thermal pad underneath the M2 drive was partially torn off just from removing the packaging seal. So, be very very careful when you do that.",
      "I initially reviewed this motherboard very poorly, due to it being defective unbeknownst to me. It ended up having a soldering defect that affected the RAM dimm slots causing constant crashes, resets and instability. I've since received a replacement motherboard and it is working perfectly, so I shall redo my review...\nAesthetically, this motherboard nears perfection, especially for a white build. It's the only one with all white components which is a huge deal. Everything else is equally as visually pleasing, from the RGB backlit Aorus logo on the I/O shield heatsink to the additional RGB under lighting beneath the chipet cover. It's nice to have additional RGB elements alongside the benefit of them being not too overbearing or tacky. All the silver metal components are nicely finished and look amazing. Overall, a very tasteful presentation.\nQuality of life features are top notch. Every SSD and it's associated heatsink has a toolless quick release, as does the main PCIe slot. There's a numeric debug LCD display, bios flashing button, onboard power and reset buttons, the latter of which can be reprogrammed to a number of different functions within bios. You can update bios without installing any components whatsoever, aside from power. All these things made the build process super easy and stress free, and makes adding and removing SSDs take no time or effort at all.\nBios is nice. It has all the features you can think of, is nicely presented and runs fast and smooth. It's not outstanding but it's above average.\nI'm deducting one star for the following shortcomings:\n6 layer PCB. At this price point and for a top end chipset, this is inexcusable.\nClear CMOS jumper as opposed to a button.\n2.5G LAN - Should be 5G at this price point and for this chipset.\nGCC software. It's horrendous, Gigabyte clearly don't know how to write software. I circumvent this software and will not allow it to be installed on my PC.\nCMOS battery is inaccessible, requiring disassembly to replace.\nThe first motherboard I received was defective, making me lose trust and confidence in Gigabyte's QA procedures.\nFinal thoughts: It's a great motherboard and will serve me well. That said, after my experience with the first being defective and better boards from different manufacturers having just been released, I wouldn't buy it again.",

      "Pros:\nNice and heavy board\nThe amount of USB-C ports (4)\nQuick release mechanisms for M.2 drives and for GPUs\nThe heat sinks for the M.2s and VRMs\nDesigned for overclocking\nEverything is labeled very nicely on the board itself\nIt looks really nice and clean\nCons:\nExpensive\nOverkill\nThe amount of USB Type A ports (6, seriously only 6?! The ROG STRIX X870E-E and ASRock X870E Taichi and Taichi Lite have 10!)\nExtremely picky with RAM\nHates any overclocking you do\nASUS’s just wonderful support team (sarcasm)\nBIOS updates not really fixing issues with this board\nMinor Grievances:\nTop most M.2 heatsink is very tall and will interfere with some AIO liquid coolers (Ex. Arctic Liquid Freezer III)\nDoes not come with a manual, but rather a quick start guide. You will have to go find the manual on ASUS’s website.\nThe only way for me to get my hands on a 9800X3D was to purchase a combo bundle from NewEgg with this board.\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis motherboard has the potential to be extremely good, but ASUS dropped the ball with this one. It’s to expensive to recommend (unless the combo deal comes back at NewEgg for a 9800X3D and this board), it is overkill for most gaming applications, and while designed with overclocking in mind, this board hates any overclocking you will do. Even just trying to turn EXPO on to get your RAM sticks to operate at their intended levels is a struggle and their support team will try to gaslight you.\nI would recommend to get an ASRock X870E Taichi or Taichi Lite instead of this board. It’s cheaper, does overclocking just as well, has way more USB Type A ports, and is just better than this board in almost every turn."

      "Its a good motherboard, i got this for 90$, wouldnt get it for retail 120$ or above, it only has 2 led and 2 pwm headers, but its still good if your daisy chaining 6 fans or less, but i used a hub in my build so i only needed 1 of each to power my 7 fans, software and bios is good, i like how i can configure the rgb through the installed software instead of other 3rd party rgb softwares. good decent motherboard",
      "Upgraded from the old Asrock motherboard after a fan header quit working. Zero problems, everything works as it should. I wish it had more fan headers but a few splitters handled that problem. Overall a good motherboard with a decent bios.",
      "Other people were saying that the wifi did not work but at least mine did flawlessly. Also pre installed io shield is a nice bonus. Wouldn't pay more than 110 for this.",
      "This board is fine, Good VRMs, it’s a good board I got it in a Newegg sale discount for $109 (plus tax. Originally was $99) this board I have seen it cost around $140 so for $109 this was a no brainer. However the reason I give it four stars it’s because I have installed the Wi-Fi drivers and it doesn’t show up in windows, basically like other reviews have said, the Wifi antenna was DOA. But thankfully out the box this supported LAN and I use it mainly so it’s really not an issue but do keep this in mind. It’s also series 5000s ready out the box so no bios was needed!",
      "Drivers took time to install, use the gigabyte control center as it finds all the drivers for you, saves you a large hassle. Good for it's price, comes with wifi."

      "I absolutely love this motherboard. I previously have had very high end motherboards, but when switching to my new case I needed a MATX board. This board has everything I need any nothing I don't at an unbelievable cost. The VRM of course is weak, but its good enough for my needs. Also in my case, it is appreciated to not have the a heatsink above the cpu due to my cooler of choice. Plenty of fan headers an 3x ARGB headers. PCIE x16 is in first slot which can be preferred in most MFF systems. I also prefer the 2 dimm design. Frankly with DDR5, I am surprised more boards haven't gone this direction. Running 4 sticks just isn't a thing in most systems unless your running stock and even then it can be hit or miss. Two M.2 slots are good enough for me. I bought a cheap low profile m.2 heatsink for the lower slot which is doing the job. I only got the non wifi edition due to stock availability. Otherwise, I would recommend getting the wifi edition for no other reason than to get bluetooth. I got around this with a usb adapter, but for me this isn't preferred with all things being equal."

      "Getting my hands on this thing was one heck of a patience trial, but I managed to grab one for MSRP and it does not disappoint in any metric. It has a feature set comparable to those found in B650E boards, but for an incredible price. Highly recommend.",
      "ATX form factor, AM5 socket, PCIe 4.0, Wi-Fi 6, DDR5 support, strong VRMs for CPU stability, RGB lighting, and multiple expansion options.\nThe Steel Legend Motherboards just look so good and gives a white build some flavor.",

      "This has been rock solid thus far under both Windows 11 and a couple of Linux variations. The only possible issue I've seen is with a USB header to the Corsair 5000D airflow case. Only one of the two USB inputs work on the case. I don't know if that is a fault of the motherboard or the case, but I will note that others have complained of the same issue on the Corsair case with various motherboards, so I am thinking it is more likely an issue with the case. However, I don't want to pull everything apart to tinker with it.",

      "I opted to get this board rather than their X850 board due to the price. I figured I would not need an overkill of a board and seeing reviews and videos on the B series got me to make my decision on this board. Overall it is a great board with no issues besides the RAM not wanting to go its full EXPO speed at 8200MT/s. Although I am pretty sure it is a 9800X3D issue regarding the RAM speed and not the motherboard itself.",
      "Only bought this because it was available and compatible with the mods I wanted to throw into the FormD T1. I do like how much connectivity it has for an ITX but it's overpriced. In the T1 you won't be able to utilize the rear M.2 slot if your GPU is in 3 or 3.25 slot mode. I preferred GIGABYTE's bios but it's easy to navigate.",
      "I’m disappointed that MSI refuses to make a black ITX AM5 motherboard, which left me choosing between ASRock and ASUS. During this time, ASRock had some quality control issues, so I opted for the ASUS motherboard. Despite the negative PR they often get, they’re not a terrible company, and they still produce some quality products. The only thing I dislike about this motherboard is the ASUS Armory Crate software required to control the RGB. Fortunately, third-party software can handle that, so it’s not a huge issue.\nThe BIOS is fantastic and user-friendly, suitable for any skill level. The VRMs and capacitors are robust and high-quality, and the heatsinks on this board are massive, definitely ready for the Gen 5 SSDs whenever Samsung releases one. One thing I didn’t like was the non-screw SSD mount. I prefer the older style, but maybe I’m just old-school. The clip mount was a bit finicky, and it genuinely took me half an hour to figure out how to use it. ASUS offers little to no guidance on this, whether in the manual, online instructions, or even on YouTube. I shouldn’t have to join a random Reddit server to figure out how to use a clip mount.",
      "Solid motherboard, excellent build quality. From a design perspective, not too flashy, which I appreciate. In terms of B850-i choices right now, it was pretty much between this and the GIGABYTE Aurus Pro. Went with the Asus because I liked this board’s USB configuration."

      "Great motherboard! Antennas don't work for me tho",
      "At first the PC wouldn't boot. I removed ram and reseated one back into the A2 slot. Then it booted and I updated the bios and reinstalled the 2nd ram stick into B2 no issues after that. Wi-Fi is amazing as expected now but I did have to connect the PC directly to the router when first installed windows due to having driver issues with Wi-fi out of the box."

      "Very good-looking motherboard, especially with white RGB. It has nice heatsinks, and the GPU release feature is a really nice touch. No complaints.",
      "It's worked well however, the software is a little iffy. Also feel like the words written on the motherboard are meh but I don't mind it much. Overall I love the look of it and fits well in my build.",
      "Motherboard itself: 5 stars\nAsus Armory Crate: 1 star\nPros:\nLots of options for customization in BIOS\nWhite motherboard looks great and is easier to see while building\nSystem runs great, no issues so far\nEasy to follow instruction booklet with step-by-step guide and labeled motherboard diagram + QR codes for additional instructions if needed\nCons:\nArmory Crate is so trash it's embarrassing. I like to give programs the benefit of the doubt because it's hard to know if bad reviews are just user error, but this thing crashed every time I used it and was unbelievably slow. I reset my computer just to remove it and have turned to open source alternatives to provide the necessary functionality Armory Crate SHOULD provide.\nThe small built-in LED area does not turn off when the device is off, even if you disable Aura lighting in BIOS. The only way to get it to stay off when your device is off is to change power settings in BIOS to ErP ready (lowers power consumption when device is off and thereby disables the light). My old power supply didn't offer ErP ready as an option but this problem was solved when I upgraded that.",
      "Looks nice! performs great! (not as good as the gigabyte white ver with the white pcb)",
      "Great motherboard with large heatsinks. Although beware, even with an updated bios, the board could not connect to the internet with its onboard wifi or ethernet. Had to use a usb wifi adapter to connect it. This is particularly troublesome as you need an internet connection when using an old ssd with your windows on it onto a new system because you need to reset your login pin. After login, I updated the drivers and everything was fine.",
      "Weak Bluetooth connection and sometimes randomly disconnects from my Bluetooth devices, such as my PS5 controller and headset.",
      "Required more force than I was comfortable with to install the CPU, to the point I was convinced I was doing it wrong. Manual could have been better organized, as it was hard to find where to connect some things. That said, nothing broke in the installation process. not an experience I'm in a hurry to repeat, but it did all go well in the end.",
      "it does well and looks well and is my go-to for white b650 mobos",
      "I am docking a star because all the \"FOR GAMERS\" stuff plastered all over this is incredibly tacky and I wish companies would stop doing that. Functionally I have no complaints.",
      "This was included in the microcenter cpu bundle but was the premium option so it costed $50 more. I sort of regret it but the reviews for the default motherboard were a bit worrying so I decided to just pay the premium, it also looks a lot cleaner imo, but if you want to save as much money as possible don't get this board. The board does everything it needs to do, the IO is fairly sized in terms of ports and installing parts went smoothly. One of my argb headers came with the pins bent really bad but I luckily managed to carefully straighten them out. Also, there are rubber coverings on a lot of important headers like the cpu fan which is nice, but they took quite a lot of force to pull out which freaked me out as I was afraid of bending a really important pin."

      "Grabbed this for $120 since it's a b850m motherboard and I didn't want to deal with compatibility issues. price wasn't much different from b650m motherboards, so why not?\nOnly 2 RAM slots but that's ideal for most builds anyways. The only gripe I have is that none of the back USB ports are 10 Gbps, but that's almost certainly never going to come up.\nPlenty of fan headers, even a dedicated AIO pump header...BIOS is fine as well...yeah no issues or complaints here."

      "This MOBO is so easy to work with and looks fantastic. I’m very pleased with it.",
      "Beast of a board for a Mini-ITX build. This thing really outperforms. There is nothing slowing you down when there is one of these in your build. At least now with Windows 11 it auto installs all the ASUS drivers needed for this, so you no longer have to touch ArmoryCrate (bloated, invasive) software. You turn off the prompt to install it from the BIOS under tools.",
      "easy to build on, hard to set up with drivers, but once you do it works great.",
      "Thick quality PCB, nice aesthetic, the logo has a hologram shine. No RGB lights included.\nFan Headers\nHas 1 x Chassis Fan header which supports up to 1A corresponding to max 2-3 fans on a splitter cable. Any more fans and you should buy a powered fan hub like the cheap magnetic Cooler Master Masterfan ARGB PWM Hub.\nUSB-C\nHas 1x front Gen 2x2 20Gbps header + 2x rear USB-C (1x 20 Gbps and 1x 5Gbps). For reference, the 5Gbps port copies @ 500MB/sec while the 20Gbps port can go up to 1000-2000MB/sec with a Gen 2 or 2x2 external SSD.\nARGB\nFor RGB it has 1 x ARGB 3-pin digital 5V header (WS2812B), and also 1 x 4-pin old RGB header. The headers work with OpenRGB so you don't need Armory Crate bloatware.\nCPU Coolers\nBe careful not to damage any small components when mounting the cooler backplate! Very narrow keep-out zones so some cooler backplates might not fit without modification eg Thermalright AXP90. (The Thermalright backplate can fit this board if you flip it over and use the longer AMD screws as per the Thermalright instructions. I used the Be Quiet Pure Rock 2 FX cooler and it fit perfect with a quality metal backplate.)\nWindows 11 Wifi and LAN Drivers\nLatest Windows 11 23H2 ISO in June 2024 still doesn't come with a driver for the Intel Wifi or LAN on this motherboard. If you don't use Rufus to flash the ISO to remove the network requirement, then you can install the proper driver during Windows installation and it's easy: download the LAN or Wifi driver from ASUS website on another computer, copy it to a flash drive, plug the flash drive in the motherboard when Windows asks for the network, press Shift + F10 to bring up cmd, type F: or G: to go to the USB drive, then type AsusSetup to install the driver (or find the right file by typing dir). Now Windows setup can continue.",
      "Great little motherboard. It has a decent amount on internal connectors for its small size, good cooling, and sturdy build quality. Having the second m.2 slot on the back of the motherboard was a great idea since it saves lots of room on the board but the caveat is less airflow. Just do not buy and SSD that it known for getting warm if putting it in the back m.2 slot.",
      "Wasn't looking for anything fancy, does the job.",
      "More than enough for what I needed but overpriced and definitely not needed for my applications. The thing literally costs more than my CPU. The VRM heatsink is also HUGE and potentially can clash with the GPU backplate which is really bizzare.",
      "is ok, a little expensive, but nice that it includes USB-C and wifi, quality is good also, debug lights are helpful.",
      "Was not my first choice for a MoBo, but definitely a step up from Gigabyte imo. (Not over-clockable, but I knew that before I ordered it. I still get a small boost from the K chip regardless though.)",

      "The ROG Strix motherboards get all the love for ASUS, but their underrated TUF Gaming line really should be on your consideration list. Great specs, solid build, two PCI card slots, lots of USB port, excellent connector placement and high quality VRM heatsinks. I've paid more in the past for motherboards that offered a lot less than this one does. Note that it tops out at PCIE 4.0 but that's more than enough for any SSD or GPU you're currently using.",

      "Decent motherboard for AM5 with good aesthetics for black builds. My only gripes with is that at non sale prices (180+) the VRMs being only an 8 phase is underwhelming. Also, do not fall for the B650-E naming scheme, because actual B650E boards do not have the dash, and therefore this motherboard is not an actual B650E and just a regular B650.",
      "Initially had to deal with long boot times due to slow DRAM POST checks, but clearing the CMOS memory fixed that.\nBoot times are very fast and I've had no issues otherwise.\nIf your boot device isn't working, you'll have to go into CSM options in your BIOS and enable USB Legacy support, then save and retry.\nThe m.2 heat sink is nice, so is the toolless M.2 installation that it offers.",
      "Got it with the 7800X3D from Micro Center like most others; it worked great and I had no problems building with it but the boot times do take a bit long.",

The antenna for the wifi is magnetic, that's a nice touch. One thing to be aware of, they put the gen5 m.2 in the first pcie slot, so the gpu starts in the second pcie slot.

      "Absolutely amazing there’s a spot for everything that you would ever need on there even for stuff you don’t use is always cover so it doesn’t look ugly and looks like something is not supposed to be there or something is supposed to be there. Would highly recommend, would you recommend?",
      "Good. BIOS took a bit getting used to, coming from Asus, but the Q-Flash worked great and was done in less than 10 minutes and there were no other issues.",
      "Great motherboard! Love that it has 4 m.2 slots and the design of it to me is great. Also its nice that the every m.2 slot has a shield on it for better cooling. The ports are all good and this motherboards serves me very well.",
      "Great budget gaming Motherboard. UEFI/BIOS is very cool looking and is easy to navigate. Also, it does support DDR5, which is nice.",
      "it's a good and was really fun to build with, only problem i had was with the psu connectors, though another comment did say it and i forgot about it, it's highly recommended to plug in the cpu power connectors before you put it in the case, the hand room is super super thin and you'll likely end up struggling to get it in there. took me around 5-10 mins",
      "Overall great MB, it has a lot of configurations and its very easy to work with, while i fell like it doesn't actually support 7200 MHz ram it still is a beast when it comes to pulling the build together.",
      "It's a mobo what's there to say?",
      "Great Mobo! not a single issue!",
      "This MOBO works very well, I would have gone with a Pricier one, but not needed for what i use it for. Used intel i7-14700KF with this mobo. You will need to update the mobo to work with the 14th gen cpu. super easy, all you do is update it when it logs into bios or you can update it after installing OS Windows.",
      "So far I have no big complaints save for one kerfuffle. When I put everything together I noticed that it wasn't POST'ing. Turns out the initial startup with the BIOS and the default configuration, turns out that process can take up to 90 seconds or even longer for it to get to the BIOS for the first time.\nThe heat sink above the M.2 drives is really nice (note it is likely that you will have to remove your GPU temporarily to install further M.2 drives).\nNotes: If you are using the Corsair 4000D Airflow do yourself a favor and plug in the CPU power on the top left of the board before putting in your cooler. Same goes with your CPU fans too (not much hand room).\nIf you're looking and you are looking to air cool with a big cooler, make sure you have enough room for your RAM."

      "Don't even get me STARTED. The motherboard itself is okay at best. It has lots of ports, and looks great, but it has weird \"EZ\" installation for certain parts like the GPU and NVME slots, which only serve to make the board difficult to learn to use, and hardly make the process easier once you do figure it out.\nI assume the drivers would be good, if I could use them. Since the board is Wifi 7, the Wifi is entirely unavailable on windows 10, which I use. There are also zero bluetooth drivers for windows 10 for this board. If I knew this beforehand, this would've been a total dealbreaker for me.\nI've had tons of issues with the bios. I dual boot Windows and Linux, and am unable to set my Linux drive as the default, since it won't even show up in the bios. The only way I am able to boot into linux is through pressing f11 to bring up the boot menu.\nI've experience a lot of issues with memory training too, and boot times are VERY long.\nI paired this board with a Ryzen 9 9950x3d, and I had to update the BIOS to be able to use it with that CPU. However, the bios flash didn't work, despite my USB stick perfectly fitting the requirements.\nI'm sure I've had more issues I've forgotten to mention, especially with the bios, but this is all I can remember for now.",
      "Bios, build quality, debugging, rgb, I/O, aesthetics are all 11/10. It is easily the best motherboard I've ever worked with. There is one obvious flaw though:\nIt is extremely overpriced.",
      "I had a MSI Z490 ACE before so went with MSI again. I am disappointed there is no ACE variant out for the X870E yet but this board fulfills all my needs. I did have some trouble with the getting my WIFI to work and could only use ethernet. I figured out that WIFI 7 only works on windows 11 and newer. I have been using Windows 10 so was forced to upgrade if I wanted to use WIFI. Other then that issue, the board has been amazing.",
      "A lesser motherboard would have suited my needs, but I really liked the styling of the MSI X870e Carbon. The board has enough integrated features I want, such as:\na lot of rear USB 3.0\nUSB 4.0\n2 NICs\ntoolless M.2 slots\nbutton release PCI 5.0 slot\nindependent PCI x4 slot from M.2 & PCI 5.0\noption to split PCI 5.0 lanes between 2 slots\nBIOS is nice to navigate.\nStable with sweet spot 6000MHz CL28 RAM 1:1 clock timings.\nAnd attractive to boot."

      "I chose this board because it seems to fit in the perfect features/price slot for me. Normally I'd go with Asus but for X870E they were all priced out of my budget, so this is my first MSI motherboard.\nRuns relatively well. The BIOS is both nice and obnoxious, as it's fast and well laid out but it automatically opts you in to some bloatware if you don't turn it off during your first time setup. There's also some overlapping features that aren't well explained and there's no physical manual to reference anything on the fly (annoying for installation).\nThe physical layout of the board is...questionable. There aren't any fan headers near the left side where most people put in fan exhausts, so you have to run them around to the bottom of the board. The front audio header is on the bottom left corner, there was no way to connect it without an extension cable (not included, ~$9 extra). I do quite like the new PCIe slot retention/ejector button. The colors are kind of ugly but whatever.\nPerformance is mostly fine. It seems to suffer from a bug that prevents wake from sleep (I'm assuming it's a general X870/x870e firmware issue).",
      "First time buying an MSI motherboard, have always bought ASUS or ASrock. For a first-time experience in setting everything up on bios, updating bios, and overall configuration, it is as easy as it can get. Everything worked flawlessly and with no hiccups."

      "Picking this part was probably the most difficult part of the build. Factoring in the quirks of every AM5 mini-ITX motherboard isn't conducive to making a decision for my indecisive self - especially not when they've been burned into my head from being the guy behind the AM5 spreadsheet.\nI ended up selecting this over competing B650 and B850 options since I have a USB4 hub in my setup with all sorts of things hooked up to it and an NVMe enclosure. It's too bad it only has one USB4 port versus two on most other X870/X870E, but that's a minor thing.\nThe VRMs are more than capable of an overclocked 9950X, too, but you could say the same for the majority of AM5 motherboards - so that's not a standout factor.\nWhat isn't forgivable, though, is the little 12500 RPM fan in the already-oversized M.2 heatsink. Make sure to put a fan curve on this thing so it stays quiet, or it'll buzz out your ears.\nGigabyte put debug LEDs on it this time, unlike their B650I Aorus Ultra (which I also previously had). Unfortunately, it's down an M.2 slot from that."

      "A complete overkill for this build. Originally, I purchased the ASRock B650M Pro RS WiFi Micro ATX AM5 (brand new) for $139.99 but then this unit was on sale (open box with warranty) on eBay for the same price! Solid VRMs which gives me so much room for CPU upgrades/OC in the future. What can I say, I just like good deals /shrug.\nRefer:\n56 AMD B650 Boards Tested, VRM Thermals\nSince this MB has multiple revisions, I accidentally tried to flash the latest BIOS designated for rev. 1.0/1.1 and it did not let me do it! In hindsight, I should have paid more attention while updating BIOS but I am glad the MB triggered an error, preventing me from bricking it. IDK if other manufactures have checks/balances like this in place but I think it is a pretty neat feature!\nI noticed when you supply power to this MB by flipping the PSU switch to ON, the RGB on the MB, along with the CPU and case fans, flash for a split second. Besides that, turning on the PC via case button does not cause this issue and I did not notice any damage to my PC components. Also, I found users on Reddit talking about the same issue with their Gigabyte MBs. For peace of mind, I called Gigabyte's customer support and was able to talk to someone who confirmed the RGB flash behavior in their own personal and server rigs. They said it is a non-issue but were happy to RMA the board right away!\nRefer:\nIssue 1\nIssue 2\nIssue 3\nIf you are using multiple NVME drives, read the block diagram carefully in your MB's manual. This MB, shares its PCIe lanes for PCIEX16 between the GPU and M2B_CPU (1st Gen4 slot). Whereas M2C_SB (2nd Gen4 slot) is on a separate PCIEX4 lane. I installed my first drive in M2A_CPU (only Gen5 slot) and the second drive in M2C_SB to avoid BW sharing with the GPU.\nWi-Fi drivers were not available during OS installation. I recommend downloading it in advance from Gigabyte's website and copying it over to a USB drive for EZ install. For me, this knocks it down a point in ratings.\nFinally, do yourself a favor and disable \"APP Center Download & Install\" in BIOS and manually install any drivers/tools that you need from Gigabyte's website (after OS install). This \"feature\" is risky and I do not trust Gigabyte to keep up with future security patches.\nRefer:\nSupply Chain Risk from Gigabyte App Center Backdoor",
      "One of the best B650 boards with solid VRMs. Q Flash worked perfectly before assembling my PC. BIOS is very easy to navigate. Plenty of PWM fan headers, m.2 slots and more USBs than I'll ever need in the back. The included wi-fi / Bluetooth antenna looks amazing.\nNote: Had a weird endless boot loop going upon initial Windows 11 installation. VGA then DRAM red debug light turned on. Had to power cycle and hard reset a couple times to fix it but been fine ever since.",
      "Looks clean, the connections were in places that made cable management easy. Comes with a heatsink for at least one of the M.2 slots, and I think it has 3 but I can't see past my massive GPU to check lol. The only complaint I have is the websites BIOS updates page. If you buy this motherboard, keep in mind this is the 2nd generation and it has a different BIOS than the other b650 AORUS ELITE AX that they sell so you need to be mindful when updating. It has some nice tasteful RGB built in if you're into that kinda thing. I'm happy with this MOBO and will likely use it until AM5 is phased out.",
      "Looks nice, good bios with sometimes working mouse support, and RGB options aren't great, but they exist. The \"EZ latch\" SSD system was nice. Beware of the amount of USB slots if you want RGB. I had to get a usb 2.0 Y splitter to attach my Strimer Cable hub. I wish there was a (good) physical manual but otherwise the board works great.👍",
      "Sleek look, good performance. BIOS is easy enough to work with, boots quickly. A little disappointing that the RGB can't be controlled in the BIOS (previous Gigabyte mobo had RGB Fusion 2.0) but it can be easily disabled so that's fine. Nice midrange(?) board.",
      "ngl, got a little scared reading this board reviews on newegg, but at the end of the day, it has been an awesome experience. I really like the heatsinks and the design, UEFI is super easy to work with. Got this with a ram combo corsair vengeance 32 gb ddr5 7000 mt/s cl36 xmp only. The XMP support of this board has been flawless for an AMD board. M.2 is easy to install, came with front I/O adapters.",
      "[This is an updated review after ~1.5 years of use]\nI've definitely come to appreciate the ample IO, as well as the 3 m.2 slots. Gigabyte's BIOS works just fine for me. If I had to redo this build I'd probably stick with this same mobo; it does everything I need it to.",
      "For me the wifi didn't work at first and i had to download drivers from another machine to a flash drive, but once i did that it's been running great.",
      "I was able to work with the minimal RGB at first, but now it's bugging me a bit. Still works fine, amazing price!",

      "A solid SFF motherboard. It ties everything together. Nice BIOS, an M.2 slot and everything you need for a small build.",
      "Only complaint is the lack of a usb-c header but besides that it works as intended. Would recommend if youre on a budget.",
      "Not my favorite motherboard, but with ITX I really compromised for size. It gets the job done",
      "All the headers were easy to plug in and it had great clearance room for a Mini ITX. Built-in WI-FI is nice. BIOS was easy to flash.",
      "Really the only downside to this thing is the lack of USB-C for front I/O, but I honestly don't really use USB-C devices on non-portable devices so it's not much of an issue, and A to C adapters are dirt cheap. Put this thing in a system with a 3700X and a 3090 when the previous board stopped working. It was a cheap option and I wanted to minimize downtime. Even though it only supports PCIE 3.0, it handles the 3090 very well when playing games at 4K",
      "Very intuitive UEFI settings, was able to undervolt with manual PBO settings with zero issues. Serves its intended purpose very well, nothing more or less. From what is provided online by competitors, Gigabyte offers the most configuration to the consumer here.",
      "Good motherboard with a load of features although no USB-C, so keep that in mind if you build in a Case with front USB-C ports.",
      "Affordable Motherboard with a good I/O, had some trouble with the front Aux, but im not sure if this problem stems from the Case or the MoBo. Bios update took some time.",
      "Solid motherboard, no bells and whistles, does its job reliably. I would use again any day for all but the most powerful AM4 builds. I wish it had a USB-C header though...",
      "Compared to most motherboards this one only runs on PCIE 3.0 compared to 4.0 on the B550i, yet this provides the best bang for the buck based on 2023 prices. I got this for $155 and compared to the Gigayte B550i is currently $233 while the AsRock B550 is cheaper but has VRM issues. Paying 34% more for PCIE 4.0, which is only about 10% better than PCIE 3.0 is not worth it at the moment for 1440p and 4K gaming.\nSure I may miss out on the 2nd M.2 slot, but that's only PCIE 3.0 and I already purchased a 2TB boot drive so I will just settle for a cheaper SATA SSD later on for more game storage. Being ITX means that I won't be overclocking at all, not to mention the $70 I've saved helped me allocate it for the GPU."

      "Not thrilled with the ASRock B650M PG Lightning Wifi board. The M.2 wireless card leads have to be connected. It was a major pain in the butt. You need three hands and 20/5 eyesight to have a shot at it. I damaged the connectors and had to spend an extra US$24 to get another wireless kit. That one had the leads already pre-connected and ready to install. Why couldn't ASRock do that too? But otherwise an excellent value B850 board.",
      "This is a great motherboard for the price, only reason I'm giving 4 stars is polychrome sync doesn't seem to want to work correctly. Other than that I definitely recommend this for any AM5 build on a budget.",
      "WIFI6e!!!! 2 pcie slots!!!! 4 m.2!!!!! great value for the price",
      "TLDR: good board with minor gripes\nFor 120$ on amazon, this boaid is a wild card. unlike some of the other B650's, this board does not throttle back and can run a bit warmer to keep up with higher TDP chips. my 7600x isn't gonna put the VRM's under any major stress, but with higher wattage chips it could potentially be an issue\nI faced an issue where XMP refused to boot, so I had to set manual DDR timings/frequency on both to ensure that it would boot with XMP (or in this case, overclocked memory).\n(if you own this board, enable power down enable, memory context restore, and potentially DDR training reduction to reduce boot times)\nthe good about this board is that the networking is outstanding for the price, it has decently modern features, and supports pretty much everything you would want for AM5.",
      "Came with an ancient BIOS version by default, and the fan control curves don't seem to do much (it seems to insist that my fans stay as quiet as possible no matter the cost, to the point of my PC locking up or shutting down) unless I manually configure them. But with the fan speed configured and the BIOS updated, well worth the price!",

      "I personally love the look of the Motherboard, though it has some things that the Z690 does better. This board does not have a CPU Flasback button, so if you get a 14th Gen CPU, you will need an older CPU to be able to update the BIOS for it to work. This board also doesn't have a Display Port on the MB, just an HDMI. At least it comes with Wi-Fi though! And it looks nice in all white builds!",

      "Great motherboard. By far the most aesthetic and cohesive option for a white build. Would be 5 stars if it had a Gen5 M.2. Also the NZXT Cam software being able to control and hide the aio pump/fans from other software is silly (I've only seen this behavior on this motherboard, so assuming its just an NZXT stack thing).",

      "Comes with what you need and nothing more. The A520 is a fine board for 65W CPUs that don't get much benefit from fancier and/or higher quality power delivery on more expensive boards. I would strongly oppose using this board for a chip like the 5800X3D because its CPU power delivery is a small 4 pin slot. Like most cheap mATX boards, the MSI A520M-A PRO only comes with one fan header besides the CPU fan header. You will need a fan splitter or fan hub to support more than one system fan that can be controlled in the bios. I bought fan splitters but was pleasantly surprised to find the case (MACUBE 310) I bought had a fan hub pre-installed in the back of the case.",
      "Newbie here. In my opinion, it's alright because its simply plug and play. I installed my Ryzen 5 5600g in it without any problems. I don't even have to update the bios.\nEDIT 12/5/2024: CLDO VDDP is missing in the BIOS but softwares like Zentimings and Ryzen Master reads it. Must be on auto I guess. Kinda sucks tho."

I also have another concern about temperature info named TMPIN5 in CPUID soft that is around 71 deg at cruise. The strange thing is that the temp sensor starts immedialty at 99 deg and then falls down to 71. Don't know if the temp sensor is not working properly or not. If anyone has a clue about it, i would be grateful",

      "In terms of product quality, this gets a 5/5, on a more realistic note however, I'd give it a 3 just due to the price.\nThis was an odd pick for me. This board costs so much beyond what I would normally consider practical (and probably still do). A couple factors contributed to this choice though.\n1) I was explicitly looking for an EATX board for expansion capability. This point alone significantly limited my options for sTRX4 boards.\n2) Higher clocks available for RAM\n3) HUGE support for NVMe (5 sockets incl. DIMM.2)\n4) Dedicated EKWB waterblock for CPU+VRM\n5) I managed to pick it up for the same price as the Zenith II Extreme (which is, admittedly, still not cheap)\nThere's little special about this board to justify the price, this was more of a personal choice, again with the prospect of being somewhat future-proof."

This is my second build with ASRock, so I've become accustomed to their BIOS UI. Nothing to write home about, but again no complaints for what it is.",
      "Cheap motherboard for the money I worked for. But it does well and is not too difficult to build with! Too bad there’s no onboard internet."

      "Good Motherboard, fits well in smaller build but still has 4 ram slots so you'r not compromising for the space and is compatible with the new 9000 series of AMD CPUs which is also great. the only reason for 4 stars is I remember struggling with what cords go where when I was doing my first build, especially for the power which has a large plug but my case only uses two prongs for the on button, just needs clearer labelling for things like that.",
      "First MSI mobo I've used (Had an Asus one before) and it works well. Looks good, very simple, has lots of connections and m.2 slots for me. Although if you do get it make sure to either have the wifi drivers on your windows boot drive or skip that connection entirely when you install windows. But its good value I'd say. Bios is also really nice and simple like the Asus one.",

      "Really good cheap motherboard and all the ports you could really need, only reason for the 4 stars is the polychrome software, which is hands down the worst piece of junk mankind has ever made. Had to buy an SATA to ARGB controller for the fans to display correct lighting.",
      "The R2.0 Version of this board is Ryzen 5000 ready out of the box and has some tweaks to make the B450 chipset livable in 2024, making it actually a decent pick if you need an AM4 board for whatever reason.\nPros: - Great VRM performance, easily capable of handling all Ryzen 7s at stock\nRyzen 5000 support on all BIOS versions\nECC memory support\nCheap\nDual 3.0 x4 NVMe, a rarity for mATX B450, and x8/x8 PCIe support as well.\nUSB-C\nThree display outs off the iGPU (great for office systems)\nAbility to set RGB from BIOS, a unique AsRock benefit.\nCons:\nOnly one ARGB header, but two 12V RGB which nothing uses anymore.\nAtrocious RGB software with limited effects and unlisted dependencies.\nAsRock's typical strange BIOS layout with related settings scattered all over the place - I couldn't figure out how to disable ErP Ready to get the LEDs off, and LLC is set as an exact value rather than a preset curve (???).\nOnly four SATA ports (one SATA Express lane got stolen to make the second M.2 x4, while the original Pro4 has 6 SATA and an x2 NVMe), and they're stacked on top of each other directly behind the PCIe slot. This can result in contact with GPUs, and in my case caused an awful rattling as the PCB of my 1070 vibrated against the SATA ports. Watch your cable management in this area.\nOverall, solid little board for cheap, especially for older Ryzen CPUs. This gets my recommendation, just be aware that it's a distinctly AsRock product and has all the weirdness that comes with that.",
      "I can't complain about this motherboard because of the price. I've had no problems with it, although there are some features I wish they included on this motherboard, like pcie x4 gen 4. But you are getting a really nice motherboard with already many features for the price."

      "A good board for a good price when i got it.",
      "solid reliability, design is beautiful, but the materials are a little cheap compared to their mid-range motherboards. Overclocking is mostly great, if youre on am4, this is a solid board.",
      "Nice quality motherboard with easy and smooth navigation in BIOS mode.",
      "Had this MB for a while before this build and performs great. No problems. Had to use the bios flashback feature before installing the CPU so that it could support 5th gen CPU's and it works great.",
      "I got a little unlucky with my first purchase; the motherboard had a defect that prevented any GPU in the PCIe x16 4.0 slot from POSTing.\nBut that's definitely not a good reason to give it only 4 stars. You can always just send it back for a replacement to the seller for free under warranty.\nEither way, this motherboard is perfect for a budget build. It has decent VRM cooling, doesn’t get too hot, and looks pretty nice in a stealthy build. It's got all the rear I/O you need. (The rear I/O shield is integrated, nice touch)\nI haven’t tried any overclocking on it and probably don’t plan to, but the BIOS is easy to navigate.\nThe Mystic Light it has, though, is really ugly. I never liked RGB. Luckily, you can just go into the BIOS and turn it off completely with one click.\nIt doesn’t have any Wi-Fi/Bluetooth built in, so you might need to buy a separate dongle or card.\nOverall, I definitely recommend this mobo.",
      "Bought this at my local Best Buy, it had everything I needed on it and more as I learned new things about modern day motherboards and what they can do. Plenty of fan headers, comes with RGB lighting control for Mystic Light (a program on the MSI center program). I will say to make sure its BIOs are updated properly or else it might not work with some CPU's due to it not recognizing it.",
      "Good overall",
      "Looks good and is easy to deal with bios. Only 4 stars because you can easily get the same quality for $30-50 cheaper",
      "Doesn't come Ryzen 5000 ready where I got it from, and BIOS flashback was tedious due to my own error, but it's got plenty of headers. The little RGB is pretty dim, so turned that off.",
      "The newest LED firmware update MSI pushed out makes it so you cannot change the RGB lighting from default on anything plugged into the USB and Jrainbow headers. Mystic Light in MSI Center greets you with the following message when you try: \"The mainboard's LED firmwware is abnormal\" then it tells you to update it. However no further updates/fixes are available. MSI customer service was beyond useless and simply told me to RMA (could take months).\nCountless others are having the same problem. Ive spent many hours searching forums for a fix and it seems MSI isn't even trying to address the issue. Spent $50 to have an independent repair shop look into it as well and they further confirmed that the MB needs to be replaced. Others have posted that the LED firmware works fine as long as you do NOT update it (via \"advanced scan\" in MSI Center).\nOther than that it has every feature I could want, but I'll be replacing it regardless."

      "Enough ports for my needs and serves right for the purpose of the build. I had to manually start Secure Boot to install Windows. Not sure if it's the MoBo's fault or Microsoft's or mine for not knowing this. Other than that, the BIOS settings were easy to navigate through and I didn't have issues overclocking the RAM or tuning fan curves. It stays cool too, at around 30C.",
      "Excellent motherboard that just works and offers solid build without all the extra and premium features that you probably don't need on other ASUS ROG models. The robust build quality makes me more confident when having to press parts with more force into the mobo. Offers easy to install sockets with safety locks mechanism for components (CPU, DDR, PCIE...). Has dedicated M.2 slot with pre-installed heatsink for SSD. Has a right enough number of ports and headers for avid casual gamers (even though the position of fan headers could be positioned better). Has a bunch of good features for components configable in UEFI BIOS, such as CPU auto-overlock (PBO), GPU resizable bar, RAM overlock (Intel XMP, AMD Expo)... Can easily config fan curve for the whole system with FanExpert. Good VRM cooling for CPU overlock. Has external WiFi antenna though not the best design. Requires 1x24-pin power cable, 1x8-pin CPU power cable, and optional 1x4-pin CPU power cable for overclocking.",
      "Compact motherboard, with everything you need, worked out of box. I did not need a BIOS update.\nThree issues:\nI had to change manually to EXPO so the RAM could work a its full 6000 MT/s, otherwise it would stay at 5200 MT/s.\nI had to disable the memory training, because it was spending around 1 minute before getting into the boot menu every single time I turned on the PC. This solved the issue: Enabling the \"Memory Context Restore\" feature (Extreme Tweaker > DRAM Timing Control > Memory Context Restore -> Enabled)\nThe WiFi and Bluetooth are not compatible with Linux Mint (Kernel 6.5), reason it gets a 4 star. I had to buy a Bluetooth dongle for like 8 USD, and keep the Ethernet cable connected. It works without any problem on Windows 11.\nFor the 3 fans, there were only 2 connections, but I managed to use the CPU OPT as a connection for the top fan. It works as usual.",
      "I can confirm, ASUS AM5 motherboards will no longer burn a whole in your CPU while using EXPO. Don't worry. If you're buying new, the motherboard ships with the BIOS version that fixed this issue (or later). This board is great for the Ryzen 7000's high temperatures, as despite being an mATX board, the VRMs are HUGE. Plenty of clearance between the AIO's CPU block and the RAM slots, so if you want 4 sticks of RAM and you use an AIO, you have plenty of room no matter where you put the tubes. The PCIe x16 locking tab is wider than most motherboards I've used, so it's easy to push it down when removing your GPU. My only real issue with this board is that the fan connectors are pretty limited and positioned weirdly. Otherwise, a fine mATX AM5 motherboard for the price."

      "so this is an amazing board to be honest, and probably the cheapest clean white one! but i did struggle on the wifi i was never able to connect to the wifi since i did buy this so i can have wireless wifi, that was a big let down, luckily i had a wifi adapter from my that one bad pc buy so it worked! just dont but if you plan on using wireless wifi or it might be a user error too. idrk im just happy to have an all white build without breaking too much bank (this was cheaper than the no wifi version for me too) oh screw less ssd btw, push down n slide to the right if u cant figure it out def have to search it up since its not in the manual how to open it",
      "Cheap X870, super clean, awesome for the money.",
      "Fine motherboard, seems to have high quality VRMs and a bunch of features I'll never use. Was the only white motherboard that fit the compatibility filter and was pretty cheap all things considered.",
      "Really good, budget x870 mobo. Really no complaints at $210 price range. Yea it’s not the best but doesn’t cost a ton either. Has everything I needed without the fluff.",
      "Motherboard ASRock X870 Pro RS WiFi ATX AM5 Motherboard $209.99\n-Have heard great things about ASRock recently and this board did not disappoint. Affordable, lots of connections, working beautifully. Wifi 7 is a game changer (coming from Wfi 4 on my previous pre-built)",

      "So far so great and love the built in rgb",
      "sturdy, easy to build. this is the first pc i’ve built so i plugged the case fans in the wrong slot. i didn’t realize the 3 pin connector goes into the 4 pin CHA_FAN2 or 3, so my fans weren’t spinning at first, but that was my mistake.",
      "Bundled at Micro Center with the CPU and RAM. I don't know if I'd pay more than $100-120 for this board otherwise-- it's a fine board but feels bad at $169 MSRP. Plentiful USB in the back, including a BIOS flash button/USB. The BIOS also has a pretty easy flash utility that uses this port-- coming from Gigabyte's bullpucky, this honestly is a great feature. Has that second M.2 slot, which I really want in this day and age, with some PCIEs for expansion. PCIE 4.0 for one of the drives. 6 SATA ports, 2 of which are blocked if you use the 2nd M.2 slot. Realistically, if you're using 2 M.2 slots, you would be using like 1-2 SATA ports then at most? Has a WIFI antenna which I didn't really test-- it feels like a nice bonus, but realistically, for work and gaming, you really want that ethernet hardline if possible anyway. Pins are sensibly arranged, VRM heatsinks nice. This board supports even the bigger air coolers. I will say this-- The BIOS isn't great, and Armory Crate RBG etc. feels bloaty and crappy.",
      "No complain. Coming with the MicroCenter bundle deal, I think the market price is a bit on the high side at $160+, but I got it bundled with 5600x3d CPU and a 16GB ram at $269. No brainer.",
      "The ASUS TUF motherboard series looks very appealing. I copped this motherboard from a microcenter combo, and it has decent features.\nGood motherboard except for one thing. The wifi just refused to not work. I tried all different kinds of bios updates, and ASUS wifi drivers. Nothing would work. I had heard from a friend the antennas were trash, so I tried my own antennas, nothing. I had to get a TP link wifi card to get me on the internet.",
      "Nice motherboard, but can’t find virtualization settings, not sure if this AM4 CPU even has it, but it has a good BIOS and doesn’t look horrible, also has good IO and enough ports to drive all of my things.",
      "Part of a bundle from MicroCenter. No complaints its an Asus Tuf mobo nothing fancy, just wish it had a built in IO shield. Just wish it came with a type-c header because now the one in the case is useless",
      "Have always loved the Asus BIOS/UEFI. Would have given 5 stars, but it has the 'Asus tax', a tad pricey for what it is.",
      "Love the BIOS",
      "probably the best motherboard for around €150"

      "Easy to setup and runs great. PCIE 5th GEN support and DDR5 support is nice as is the intel 14th GEN support. WIFI is very fast with external antenna. Great product.",
      "Great features and appearance!",
      "Great. Just wish it had more PCIe-5, and if it had WIFI 7 support, it would be perfect. So it's not future proof, but for current it's top notch. Easy M.2. installation latches Thunderbolt possibilities are a nice extra touch.",
      "Great motherboard, had trouble installing Armory Crate but an uninstall followed by reinstall fixed it. M.2 SSD heatsinks bend the ssd a little bit if screwed on too tight. Lots of SSD slots and great VRM cooling. Future proof!",
      "Initially, I tried running 4 sticks of 5600 corsair vengeance ram for 128gb as it is shown on Asus's official website that this is the highest speed for 128gb ddr5. (two sets of 2x32gb). I finally got it stabled after a lot of trial and error but after the newest bios update (version 1402), it would not post with 4 sticks at 5600 anymore. Therefore, I had to swap back to 2 sticks. 4.5/5"

      "First time building an itx and had no issues with this board. I don’t know enough about boards to offer further input but where this was priced compared the lower speced options seemed like a decent buy. Only one rgb header which may be troublesom for those of you who lack refined tastes",
      "Really great little board, meets all my IO needs (NR200 is a bit dated), and at a great price. 9800x3D and 6000 CL30 ram worked out of the box. My only wish is that the HD audio header was closer to the right side, because running the cable all the way across the system means some minor audio interference if the GPU is under load.\nThe included non-proprietary antennas are also a very welcome addition.",
      "It works. I haven't encountered the whole ASRock vs 9800X3D debacle (BIOS version 3.15).\nI wish they gave us a thermal strip at the very least so the M.2 on the rear could at least (potentially) disperse heat to the case.",
      "UPDATE: Dead after a week due to complications with the CPU. If you are running a 9800X3D with this board, you must update your BIOS from the default 3.15 to minimize risk of sudden death.\nThis things rules. I gave AsRock a hard time with an old AB350 motherboard that gave me fits, but this thing is a work of art. Zero issues with component attachment, BIOS operation, tweaks, or anything. Just an FYI though: there is no RGB on it (which is good). The big i/o cover is really brightly colored, but it is not obnoxious."

      "Very cool motherboard\nProbably the best X870E motherboard. Offers everything the more expensive boards have but at a much lower price. Priced around that of the Strix, Aorus Master and MSI MPG Carbon but offers way more on the hardware side at least. Not to mention the backplate, this and the Phantom Gaming are the only X870E boards to have one aside from the Maximus Crosshair or Godlike which are massively more expensive.\nRear IO is also lacking compared to some of the competition but is plenty for most people. For those of you needing 1 billion USB 3.2 gen 2 ports, look for the Strix specifically.\nSoftware-wise it can be lacking. The BIOS is on the older side and the Asrock utilities are lacking compared to the competition. But this way it is essentially bloatware-free, a pro for many people who want to avoid things like Armory Crate.\nAgain, good value compared to everything else.",
      "Very good motherboard, but unless you need all the amenities the board offers, such as 6 SATA connections, it is likely better to stick with something significantly cheaper.",
      "Was perfect for my 9800x3d build, has everything I need and could want.",
      "the SATA connections, M.2 slots, USB... all the connectivity is very nice if you have the space for it. If I am honest, something cheaper would probably have been enough, but it seems like a relatively reasonable price for a \"flagship\" model."

      "The manual is great but doesn't come in the box, so you'll have to get it from MSI's site. The BIOS GUI is easy to work with. Wi-Fi is fast and the Bluetooth connected to a PS4 controller easily. Getting the case's front headphone jack to behave normally required some simple troubleshooting and configuration in the driver software.",
      "Does everything it needs to. Plenty of USB 3 & USB C ports. BIOS can be a little confusing to maneuver if you're new to PC building like me and not sure where to look for certain settings.",
      "Great motherboard, nice design and enough USB ports",
      "Works good, has a decent bios."

      "Extremely happy. Would have liked a better built-in RAID controller, that will take full advantage of PCIe 4 enabled NVMe drives such as my Samsung 980 Pro. Although, I get in RAID 0 with two drives, about 10 GB/s seq. read. speed, the write speed went down the drain as the disks got to about 50% capacity. Currently, I am struggling with 3GB/s seq. write speed and I do not know what is going wrong.",
      "Expensive board for what it is and a bit of a rub to be needed after the x399 chipset was killed so soon. It has lots of headers you wouldn't think you'd need, but end up coming in handy once you go watercooled or plan to do liquid nitrogen. That said some of the water cooling headers are proprietary and you can't find hardware to use them. Excellent overclocker with Ryzen Master and the 3970x"

      "I can’t really give a good critic review since I’m not that knowledgeable. so all I can say is that it’s probably the best priced mobo i could find at around 77€ and it looks nice as well. So far I haven’t had any problems with it.",

      "First time using an ASRock motherboard. The BIOS was a pleasant experience compared to the first MSI board I worked with a couple years ago. VRM heatsink is sharp and sliced my thumb open when I went to install the 8-pin EPS cable to cable manage the system after changing out a CPU I used to update the BIOS (which is a breeze with this board). I probably wouldn't suggest using this board for any power hungry Ryzen 7 or 9 chips.",
      "Great board I have had no problems with it.",
      "Very good for the price. Has plenty of fans header, two m.2 slots, m.2 for wifi module and RGB headers for RGB fans. Didn't have problems after overclocking 5700X.",
      "Cheap motherboard with good audio! I liked the silver aesthetic enough to choose it over its competitors. The RGB and fan headers weren't in the most convenient spots, but it does the job. I also wish it had WiFi/Bluetooth but I was willing to make that sacrifice for the $90 price point. EDIT: After around 6 months, I started getting USB Controller errors that prevented me from adding more USB devices and/or even using the microphone on my Bluetooth headset. I am therefore downgrading my review."

      "As I, originally, wrote under the \"Cons\" section, such things are inexcusable for a flagship and Gigabyte still hasn't learned a thing nor care to. Despite not (currently) experiencing the issue, I can't in good conscious recommend this product. Get the Taichi, Hero, or wait for the Asus Extreme releasing this summer...\nOriginal review:\nPros: The specs are excellent. Considering I got it for $699.99, the dual 10 Gb ethernet and thunderbolt/USB4 were made it a better value than the Asus Hero ($699.99). Oh, and it's bundled with a proper user manual booklet - just like the good ol' days!\nCons: Sigh... Gigabyte's notorious software remains unmatched, and the latest BIOS update caused my text to randomly switch to Spanish, making tinkering with the settings cumbersome. This is inexcusable for a flagship product.\nOverall, Gigabyte's design language is preferable to the \"look at me: an uber gamer!\"motif of MSI and ASUS flagships. While I'm holding out for Zen 6, this board seems well-equipped to handle my 192GB @ 6000+ MHz around that time."

      "Love this motherboard. I saw a pretty significant improvement with CPU undervolting and RAM timing stability over the cheap Gigabyte B650 board I bought initially. Only knocking off a star because the BIOS is just as bland/unintuitive as it was in the X570 Taichi board.",
      "A lot of quality of life features. Extremely nice to work with.",
      "Choose it because of aesthetics and no lane share for the GPU. Works well right now.",
      "One of the cheapest options for M.2 storage which doesn't foul the GPU lanes. No complaints, looks great. ASRock software is a bit underwhelming however I won't knock points off the motherboard for it. 5/5 MoBo, 2/5 Software.",
      "Good motherboard, the price is unbeatable especially compared to the other X870E boards. 5 M.2 slots that don't have GPU lane split. Runs my RAM at 6400 MHz at CL30 with a 7800x3d. I don't overclock so I don't really know the upmost limit that I can push this board up to."

I wish it only had 2 ram slots, as it looks ugly with only 2 sticks installed. love how easy it is to remove the GPU and to put in a m.2 drive. would like more argb ports tho.

      "Great board, love the look, its connectivity is great and the integrated I/O shield is a blessing for the price I got it for. Very easy-to-use BIOS, but there is one unfortunate point: the board only has 2 ARGB headers, so keep that in mind if you want to use many ARGB devices with this board. Not enough of a gripe for me to give it 4 stars though. Absolutely recommend as a mid-range board!",
      "bios has given me some issues little finicky with resizable bar after bios update",
      "Good, would recommend a wifi board tho as i struggled to install windows 11 and needed to install windows 10 then upgrade to 11. Other than that its perfect.",
      "A good motherboard for the price. It has lots of fan headers and RGB headers.",
      "only had it for a couple days, has everything I need it for with extra pcie slots and m.2s.",
      "Considering it's price and the fact it came 5000 series ready, yes, just yes",
      "Good looking, and functions well for the price.",
      "Solid board at a good price. 2 M.2 slots so you can have your boot drive and then room to add more storage in the future. Finding the 4G+ encoding support in the BIOS was a bit tricky though and while the shroud behind the I/O panel is cool it kind of gets in the way.",
      "this motherboard is so basic it probably watches friends",
      "Perfect no nonsense board for a gamer. Gigabyte has really upped their game, they were already great, but now with BIOS UI updates and their support software (like the app center) they are even better."

      "This motherboard is perfect for white builds and looks super clean. Bios is easy to navigate and finding all the driver was a peice of cake. The only issues I've come across as been ram compatibility as I had a pair of 16gb sticks equalling 32gb that wouldn't work with the motherboard however after looking in the motherboards manuals and finds a list of compatible ram this issue was shortly fixed. When attempting to overclock the ram in the mb bios it doesn't seem to like xmp file 1 and refuses to post if put on the settings this could be due to the ram I'm using tho however xmp 2 and 3 seem to work fine.",
      "Love that it still uses standard threaded wifi plugs. Easy layout. Great M.2 shield plate keeping two nvme gen 4 drives under 50'C during gaming session. I did minus one star because the pcie 5.0x16 slot's gpu release tab broke off three instances of removing and inserting the gpu. I've had Asus boards that use aluminum stickers or shielding on the tab to reinforce it but this board did not have that. Otherwise GPU is secured in place, hopefully no reason to need to remove again. RGB Fusion 2.0 software also sucks, did not detect fans but is necessary to change ram colors.",

      "A little more silver than white, but still looks great. Having some issues with the VGA light even though drivers are all installed/updated and monitor is working fine. Will figure it out but for the time being it doesn't really bother me. RGB software is a little buggy.",
      "Nice white motherboard with a nice layout. It's in no way a ROG motherboard, but still pretty solid.",
      "it does as it says on the tin BUT!!! if you use proprietary RGB programs from different makers right out of the tin, there were so many software crashes. also had back-to-back BSODs which i believe were related. all of the red LEDs for troubleshooting on the motherboard have come on at least once at any one time. things have calmed down now that many fixes had been applied.\nthree stars for griefing and not being dummy-proof. (me, i am the dummy.) that said, it's white and nice, and got many ports for like, stuff. cool."

      "Following the ASUS controversy, I really steered towards ASRock instead buuuut it wasn't available when I was buying. Works perfectly well with 9700x AMD out of the box, decent BIOS, IO, and the works. Can't complain!",
      "i just love this tiny mobo , the best one for ITX cases and no coil whine in my unit",
      "Best price x performance AM5 ITX board with PCI-E 5.0 GPU slot and USB4. Might need BIOS update to support 9000 series, but ez flash is indeed very easy 👍",
      "No complaints except the price.",
      "Nice, compact motherboard! First AMD for me in over 25 years (back from the Pentium 486 days!). Runs smooth and stable with the Ryzen 5 7600. The VRM fan is completely silent, and I haven’t experienced any coil whine.\nTeenage Engineering Computer-1 Front Panel Audio Fix for Asus B650E-I\nTip (L) → Pin 9 (PORT2L) Ring (R) → Pin 5 (PORT2R) Sleeve (GND) → Pin 2 (AGND)\nNote: The Asus B650E-I motherboard does not include the AC97 option in the BIOS, so front panel headphone detection must be triggered both manually via software and physically through the AAFP header.\nSolution: Use a female-to-female jumper wire to connect Pin 7 (SENSE_SEND) to Pin 6 (SENSE1_RETURN) to manually trigger detection.\nFinal Summary for Teenage Engineering Computer-1 Builders:\nTo enable front panel audio on the Teenage Engineering Computer-1 case with the Asus B650E-I motherboard, make the following connections: - Tip (L) to Pin 9 (PORT2L) - Ring (R) to Pin 5 (PORT2R) - Sleeve (GND) to Pin 2 (AGND)\nThen, bridge Pin 6 (SENSE1_RETURN) and Pin 7 (SENSE_SEND) with a jumper wire to force headphone detection. 🎧\nAfterward, adjust the settings in Realtek and Windows output device to switch between sources manually.",
      "Almost perfect motherboard, only thing I feel like I can criticise it on is it's slow boot time, and how it only has 2 NVMe slots, but other than that lovely ITX board was able to get for 200e as an unwanted gift, also love the antenna, also no on board fan noises that have been mentioned online, which makes sense as this was made more recently",
      "Why. Is. This. Board. So. Expensive.\nIf you can, get the Asrock instead for $100 less. I had to go with this one as all B650i’s in my country were around the same price point. But still a solid board.",
      "Easy to build with and high quality components, but setting up Windows with it was a bit of a chore. Settings I had set in the bios weren't properly recognized by my installation media and once I did override checks to get it working the board had no internet drivers. Once again that was easy enough to bypass and now that Windows is installed everything seems to working as intended!",
      "I bought it from Newegg, and it was advertised as \"ready for 9K\" with a factory release in November. However, it still required a BIOS update. The update was super easy — all I needed was a USB drive and another computer to download the update files. 5 Star if you can buy it MSRP.",
      "Great tiny motherboard with all the features needed! Would love to see it $100 cheaper but it’s still a good value even at $399."

      "BIOS update was easy, thing was snappy. Once you have a stable build, I highly recommend disabling “80 Port Display Mode\".",
      "Aesthetically pleasing and easy to build on. Loved the ease of M.2 installation. No complaints.",
      "Good motherboard, had no real issues with it. The only thing that bothers me is that for a reason the Q code display keeps showing the code 08 after boot, after some research it seems it's normal.",
      "Great Motherboard, EZ latch was easy and IO shield preinstalled"
