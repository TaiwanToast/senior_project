      "This thing ive had since i fist got my xbox one like 7 years ago and it has never failed me. Ive also traveled with it often and never had problems. 10/10",
      "easy to use and setup external storage. Simple as that.",
      "UPDATE: Computer intermittently stops seeing that this thing exists. Usually it's fine, but I lost access to most of my files for a month and had a bit of a scare. It seems to stop working when it's being used a lot, but I bought a different external drive I use for backups now, and I have a new internal drive now that I keep games and software on, and an SSD for the OS.\nIf you need a good chunk of storage now so you can worry about an SSD later, this thing is your best friend.\nI bought this when I had 500GB of games on my computer (on a 1TB hard drive) but didn't have another drive bay for an HDD. I needed space, not speed, so getting an SSD was out of the question. For less than $100, this thing is amazing. I use it to keep my massive video editing files, which have freed up 400GB for more games. It feels much faster than it supposedly is, and the read/write speed are awesome. I'll never be able to use all 4 terabytes of space, and by transferring my files, I solved a several-month-long storage crisis.",
      "I see nothing wrong with this drive at under 4 cents per gb, unless you're reading this in the far future where people use gigabytes as toilet paper, in which case: how does that work and where did all the trees go",
      "Can you say win? 4 TB for less than $125! USB 3.0 has steady transfer speeds as fast as the source can give. I'm seeing 80-100 MB/s and loving it!",

      "Cheap and easy to shuck, though it's not always clear what model you'll get inside. Similar to the easystore model that's exclusive to Best Buy, but more broadly available. Note that some (older?) shucked drives may require taping over or otherwise disconnecting the 3.3 V supply, and they may also require a smartctl command to enable TLER on every boot.",
      "Using this for File History backup of various machines. It's large and goes on sale fairly often. Knocking off a star because the drive isn't decoupled from the enclosure well, and the enclosure bottom isn't really cushioned, so if you get it on a dense surface (solid wood, say), the HDD vibrations are amplified annoyingly."

      "The WD Passport 5TB external HDD is a solid performer. After I nearly lost data to malware, resolved to start using a true backup system on a regular basis. I bought the WD My Passport when I saw it on sale, I figured its 5TB capacity was perfect for long term data backup and storage.\nThe Acronis True Image utility packaged with the WD makes it easy to setup and use a regular backup recovery process. Once installed and configured the WD drive with the Acronis utility is easy to use. If I install, upgrade or remove any programs, update system parameters, or just make changes to my spreadsheets, I make sure to start a fresh backup before I shutdown the PC. I just start the backup according to the options I set and the system takes either an incremental or full image backup. I have the backup options set to take a full disc backup after taking 5 incremental backups."

      "its alot of storage but damn this thing loves to freeze my windows when i try to move alot of files or big files. it starts out fine but after 30-40 seconds the transfer speed just drops to 0 and stays like that for a good minute or forever and the only way to fix it is to unplug and replug it. this thing has straight up freezed windows completely and made explorer.exe crash- now maybe thats just my end but if you have this problem too youll need to pause and unpause the transfers frequently to keep it from freezing\nalso should it suddenly stop working unplugging it in this order: unplug usb, unplug ac, replug ac and replug usb should bring it back.",
      "Waiting for the other shoe to drop. There HAS to be a reason these are so cheap, right? I've bought a ton of these because they are so cheap compared to other 8TB drives, but when I crack open the case, all I see is a normal Seagate Barracuda drive. The bare drive is going for $200 while this is $150, I can't tell what the difference is, though. This is a GREAT deal, I've bought several now and tossed the USB enclosures, and so far the drives have been working fine. No issues with any of the three I have purchased (all are less than a year old, keep in mind.)"

      "It's a no frills portable HDD, no included software, just the cable and the drive. Plug it in and that's it. The speeds are pretty average for a portable USB 3.0 HDD and it's sturdy but very plasticky; you can hear it creaking if you put any pressure. The wire is also very short but that's easily remedied if you want to spend a few bucks on a micro-usb 3.0 cable. Biggest issue with the product is its size; it's huge and fat for a portable HDD. There are many much slimmer models on the market with more attractive casings as well. Still, 2 TB for $80 isn't bad at all and hopefully that added size translates to better durability."

      "I look at tons and tons of reviews of products online and always think 'that guy must have gotten a dud'. Today, I am that guy. I had this thing for right over 2 years, normally disconnected from the computer and connected when I wanted to backup something or get something from my backup. I connected this drive around july of 2020 and to my surprise, it would not connect, despite the lights coming on on the housing. I tried a new cable I had that was 3.0 as well, and still no luck. I phoned seagate to be told that the drive is no longer in production and they could only offer a discount on another drive, since my warranty was only for 2 years.... of course it goes out a month after the warranty was gone. I went to check cables without moving the drive, and knew it was dead because it was clicking... very loudly. I then found out that this drive is on the list of 'SMR' drives and SMR was not advertised w/ the drive at first. It is a 5TB drive with 128MB cache, but it is not a 'hybrid' drive. It looks like a normal drive, but most drives with huge cache sizes end up being SMR. I'm not 100% sure, but most sources list it as SMR. So, losing all my data, and seemingly 115$ that I paid for the drive (on sale but irrelevant). Seagate said they could attempt to recover the data, for a price of course.... 100% not satisfied with this product as a backup drive. It stayed in a cool area, dust exists everywhere, but i keep the area clean and dust it frequently. I can't recommend this drive to anyone looking for a long term backup solution.\nAlso, I ended up taking the drive out of the enclosure to run a test to see what the issue is, and the drive itself is 100% the issue, and it's failed beyond repair. Side note, if there's anything positive, it's how tight the enclosure is made around the drive. I think that might have been a bad thing in the end, however.\nNote: I keep two backup drives, if one fails, you have to do another anyway!",
      "Loud when it's in action but as my long term storage and OS backup, I can deal with the little extra noise when it's active. Ease of use migrating files to and from other internal drives. It's as simple as copy and paste or simply drag the files into the external drive.",
      "Needed something that had a lot of storage to keep my backups, i had run in several problems with my PC that i had to restore the whole PC to default. This expansion will save me alot of trouble. It really is plug and play, you just hook it up and in seconds is already recognized and able to store.",
      "Had to RMA one because of Read/Write errors.",
      "Works good so far,using it as a internal hdd, i removed the cover and installed it inside the case, probably lost the warranty but whatever.Wanted something big for all the crap i download.",
      "Trying this out after my 3TB WD MyCloud drive's network controller crapped out on me. Using it as a NAS attached to my router with FTP access, is working great so far. I did not really need it for this build, but I wanted a new NAS for PC backups."
