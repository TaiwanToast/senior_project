Essentially this is just an M.2 Intel AX200 WiFi card connected to a PCIe adapter, with the two little antennas from the M.2 card attached to a thing where you connect the big boy antenna that comes with this.

      "I haven't had to use the WiFi card that much yet because the last time I had my PC set up I had access to Ethernet connection. I snagged this from my grandparents' house because everything in their house is already completely WiFi connected and this was just laying around. It has a little antenna crown with magnets and a foam foot pad, so I can just stick it to the side of my PC case or somewhere magnetizeable and it'll stay securely. This card works nicely. I don't care about having late model WiFi technology and I'd rather just use wired connections, so this fills a niche for me for when I'll need to use it.",
      "just arrived shortly, will be installed soon !",
      "Good for getting Internet, for me, personally, it doesn't work at its full potential, but when closer and you can't run an ethernet cable it works amazingly",

      "Reused wlan adapter",
      "Great connection, easy to install. Downloads go crazy fast. I just downloaded the software onto a usb drive from the website since I don't have an optical drive.",
      "Does great! Although if you're using the Corsair Spec 02 case with a Z390H board, don't use this. The PCIE slots do not line up for this Network adapter to fit properly. I needed to remove (bend outward like a handle actually) one of the guard bars for this adapter to lock into place. Otherwise? I haven't had anything negative about the piece of hardware working! It just doesn't play nicely with my case.",
      "Absolute let-down. Bought this thinking it was going to give me the max speed on my internet, but to my surprise, it can barely get a signal from the 2.4 band, let alone 5. I ended up using the Intel 9260 adapter that came with the mobo. That worked amazing and gave me my max with full bars on the 5GHz band. This Asus adaptor is now sitting collecting dust in my parts box.",
      "No drops on WiFi , very small and compacted profile. I use the 3 antennas on the desk with the extra cable and holder that came with it.",
      "Pretty fast. Fast enough to not bottleneck my ****** internet anyways, so not really a high bar to set."

      "Worked straight out of the box, haven't installed any drivers (although it did come with a CD... in 2024). It requires one cable to plug into one of the USB headers on the motherboard, and it has ketchup and mustard at both ends, so that's why I'm taking a star off. Great speeds, I did a test and got 70mbps download and 19mbps upload, which I think is good.",
      "Needed a Wi-Fi adapter after one I bought from amazon became a POS and stopped working, and my friend had this he was willing to sell to me for $20 because he bought it thinking he was going to use it. He ended up using ethernet, so he had no use for it.",
      "Initially I wasn't going to bother with having a wifi/Bluetooth adapter but I had a cordless bluetooth keyboard in my cupboard that I'd always hoped to use. I'm now planning to replace my mouse with a bluetooth version. The current mouse needs a USB dongle to communicate through but one less thing plugged in taking up a USB port is always a good thing. The range of the signal on this card is greater than expected and it was super easy to install.",
      "Works well. Have a good bandwidth. Bluetooth is reliable. I sometimes use cable connection when i need more speed, but is enough if you are patient with downloads.",
      "Worked great out of the box! Didn't have any issues with installation",
      "Does it’s job as advertised. Very reliable and stable connection for me. Just be wary if your gpu has a thick backplate and your putting the card in a pcie slot ABOVE the gpu. Metal-sticky-outtie bit coming from the pcie bracket on the Wi-Fi card may interfere.",
      "Ok wifi card, but it gets bad signal when under my desk (yes, with the antennas) and it doesn't make it clear that you have to attach a completely separate cable for the bluetooth",
      "Intel AX200 under the hood.",
      "It's quick and it was easy to install into the motherboard. But on Windows 11, installing the drivers were a pain. I had to go into Device Manager, look at the hardware ID, and then copy/paste that into a search engine and find a suitable driver. At first I was looking for Asus drivers for the wifi/bluetooth, but it turns out the drivers are all from MediaTek."

      "The worst experience of this build. I didnt have a disc drive so I thought I was screwed, but the manual said just go to this support link and download the installation drivers. So I thought sweet its doable. Little did I know that their installation drivers are broken so I spend hours trying to figure out the problem. It wasn't my PC, it wasn't my Internet connection, it wasn't anything I did wrong. 4hrs later I finally found someone who had posted and advised to just go to the Intel website and download the Wi-fi installation drivers there. Once I did that and restarted my PC, my Wi-Fi was working.",
      "It's decent. The signal strength is good, the response times are quick, and the added heatsink is a nice touch. It works really well about 99% of the time, but under really heavy use like moving large amounts of files across a wlan, it'll shut itself down."

      "One of the antenna screws came a little lose but it still works fine, no complaints.",
      "By far, the worst experience of the build. This card works fine, the problem is the drivers. The TP-Link drivers on the website are terrible, I was getting massive ping spikes every 20 seconds, and it got to a point where my PC would just BSOD before I could log in. I tried everything. So basically I just had to install different drivers. I think this card runs on a Realtek 8812AE chipset, so I just installed the drivers for it. When using the application, windows will automatically assume that TP-link's drivers are the best one, so you have to manually select the correct driver and installed it. Worked perfectly after doing this. My ping is only a bit worse, but worth it considering I can actually play games now.",

      "The range isn't brilliant and the connection to my 60MB/s Wi-Fi is very unstable, fine for web browsing and downloading files however when attempting to play FPS games the ping ranges from 100-300. Wouldn't recommend for serious gamers.",

If you have the extra budget wiggle room and a free pcie slot i would definitely recommend it.

Plus, on here it says the model is 9636, but on the Amazon link it's 9655S and on the box itself it's 9658 :I. The Wi-Fi did not work out of the box even tho others say you didnt have to download drivers for Wi-Fi. Tho, I'm not 100% sure if that's just because I had Windows 11 since on the card it says wind 10 and 11 but then on Amazon says Windows 10?",

The bluetooth is finicky, but reseting the drivers and disabling anything that conflicts with them should fix that. Bummer they don't work out for some, but for me all three I've built have worked flawlessly so far.",

      "I needed WIFI and since the motherboard did not have onboard WIFI I had resort to a third party solution. I did research and PCIE WIFI cards typically give better results than USB ones do. I still think I overpaid for this but TP Link has burned me in the past. Works fine for what It is.",
      "Works better than the USB Wifi adapters but I had some trouble with the drivers. I spent quite a while trying to get it to work and ended up needing to avoid downloading drivers for it since I'm using Windows 10.",
      "I don't really use wifi because I run cat 6 to every room in my house, but it's something I'd rather have and not need than to need and not have. Tested it out on my att fiber optics 1,000mbps internet, was only getting about 300mpbs speeds with the router sitting right next to my pc. With the ethernet hooked into the pc I get 980mbps speeds",
      "Good reception even through a few walls to the back of the house. I did splurge on this wifi card because it is red and pretty; I could have gotten away with the blue PCB one but due to my current wifi speeds; but my tax refund had come back and felt I had a little extra to burn.",

The Wi-Fi antenna are great and they give me full bars whereas my old card only got two.\nMy only complaint is that it didn't come in a more neutral color such as black, but it is barely noticeable under my GPU.",
      "This is an amazing card if you can get it to work, I could get it to work on the 2.4GHz network, but the 5GHz wasn't showing up for my router. I contacted ASUS for support, but they said that it was the router at my house. I looked further into it and found out that it is the channel of the 5GHz network that needed to be changed. I changed the networks 5GHz to a different channel through the router settings, and it works perfect now.",

I don't know what the reason why it died, but it did after over a year and a half of use. 0 corrosion, 0 outside damage.\nFor anyone thinking on buying a WiFi card, buy a WiFi card that lasts longer, and has warranty.

But hear me out, this thing has an Intel chip in it for $26 and gets me 200mbps on a good day when no one is home while I am a floor above the router. But Windows being Windows TURNS OFF my WIFI for no apparent reason mid-game or just randomly when I'm browsing. I've tried at least 3 different adapters on my system on 2 different motherboards and the Home and Pro version of Windows. It seems as if Windows sucks at managing WIFI traffic, and sadly powerline is out of the question since I only get 20mbps through it. (Must be how my home wiring is set up). For now it is working well, I just can't put my PC to sleep or the same thing will happen again for months until it fixes itself magically one day.",
      "Pros: Cheap, Wifi 6, comes with screwdriver, drivers are pre-installed (at least for me), easy to install, nice packaging\nCons: antennas can get in the way sometimes, you need to install drivers thru a disk or online if they aren't pre-installed.\nThoughts and opinions: Overall, I recommend this product for anyone looking for a cheap wifi 6 card. No real issues so far besides the antennas getting in the way but it isn't that big of a deal. 4.5/5",

Bluetooth works fine. There’s a USB port on it, but I’m not entirely sure what it’s for. Note that this card plugs into a USB header, so you might want to have a spare one. Haven’t tested if it works without it.",

I was stalking it on task manager and watched it give up and flop to byte bottom.\nEveryone said “just get a USB adapter” and I thought, “ew no, it’s usb and probably has poor connection.” Absolutely wrong, returned this disappointment of silicon and chose a USB adapter instead for $20 less! It’s cheaper, and offers better performance. I mean honestly leave tp-link out of all your connection needs, they’re an unreliable brand as I’ve also seen in their wifi extenders.",

The bluetooth can run keyboard/mouse combos, media remotes, game controllers, head-sets etc.\nFor gaming, like Counterstrike, the wifi was acceptable if your signal is good.",

The device seems to take a while to connect on startup compared to the rest of my services, but it's usually working within 30 seconds. I broke the antenna recently, but cannibalized another from a friend's old PC to get it working again.",

      "Used this in two builds, but I don't know that I'd buy it now that the price is higher. I love the magnetic antenna that this comes with. Small and easy, it's really just an M.2 E-type port on a PCIe adapter card. Depending on the mobo/case, you might need a splitter for the USB ports, if you only have one header and a couple of things to plug into it.",

I got it because I am not able to have my computer directly hooked up to my modem/router but my internet speeds have been really fast still so I haven't had any issues there. The USB cable has the ugly ketchup/ mustard colors so get some black electrical tape haha. also the antenna could have better maneuverability and definitely a stronger magnet or better base in general because it tries to slide around on my case unless it is sitting up right.",

      "Couldn't tell the difference of lan or wireless with this one.",
      "High Speeds and steady connections!",
      "When it works, it works really well.\nIt might be my unit specifically, but sometimes it randomly shuts down and I can't do anything to reboot it. I have to either close my computer or restart it everytime. The cumulative time I spent online to test and try to find a solution now amount to more than a day and to this day, nothing fixed it completely.",
      "First thing, IT IS REALLY FAST. but when you run it in linux, after the computer wakes from sleep, it may not reconnect",
      "This is an excellent piece of hardware. It is fast, has amazing coverage and a low power draw. It has blistering speeds that on a 5GHz network are superior to a LAN cable for me. Plus it allows me to put my PC anywhere and not be dependant on an internet source. The only piece I salvaged from my old PC, I do really appreciate what this piece does for me.",
      "My God this thing is fast. But then again, we did pay for fast.",
      "Originally had a 20 dollar TP Link adapter that worked well for the first few years, I would usually have a direct connection anyway. However when I moved to Germany a physical connection was not possible. The modem was in my basement so I ended up mounting my router in my living room with a discrete line to the modem downstairs. This was as close as I could get to my pc as I could but it was still not an ideal situation. I had a 200 mb/s connection but was only getting 90-120 via the TP link. So I gave the Asus a try despite the price, let me just say, money well spent. With the Asus adapter I was now getting 190 + speeds, and boy do I miss those days as I currently live in an area where I can only get 5 mb/s now lol.",
      "Has no problem getting fast speeds, the antennae add a nice character to my case too. It's also magnetic which is super helpful. Found used on r/Hardwareswap."

      "Had a bad experience with a TP-Link wifi card (a brand I usually really like), sent it back and after doing a bit of research took a punt on one of these from Amazon. Wasn't expecting to be blown away but I was really happy that unlike the TP-Link, it connected to my home wifi at the max throughput my broadband can deliver every time. Another plus is that it uses the standard Intel drivers you download from Intel.",
      "Meh. It's a WiFi card. Intel AX210 chipset which is basically the only relevant one now, drivers work, antennas work, comes with LP bracket and screwdriver. Power cable quality is poor and it broke for me. The chip is also not removable as if the card uses an M.2 socket, it's obscured under a permanently fixed heat spreader. Look for a card that has the M.2 connector exposed; heat spreaders and heatsinks are not necessary on a WiFi card.",

      "Not bad Wi-Fi adapter. If you're gaming you should use ethernet anyways. Decent for schoolwork or small downloads.",
      "Really Wis my Fis.",
      "My roommate gave me this from his old build. Seems to do the job pretty nicely.",
      "I know that it's always best to go wired, but it's not practicable due to the location of my PC. The T9E performs very well when it connects and seems to pick up a strong signal despite the distance. I'm able to max my 350 Megabit connection. Sometimes however it will get stuck in a unable to connect loop and the only way to resolve it is to disable and then enable the device again. After a bit of online research, I can see that others have had similar problems.",
      "Originally had the rig hardwired but GF made me relocate my rig from the living room to the bedroom... THIS ACTUALLY WORKS. Had a cheap USB WiFI adapter that did the job but nothing compared to this TP-Link Archer. Also spent a couple extra dollars on longer antennas, which are ridiculously long, to assist with the connection. But after comparing the stock antennas with the long ones, the longer antennas made no difference.",
      "Coupled with a really good night hawk router it is just like using Ethernet, i never get drops and the internet speed is the same as Ethernet.",
      "This thing is about a step above a $20 USB Wi-Fi adapter, seriously. I have a Netgear Nighthawk X4S less than 35 feet away from me (and one sheet rock wall) and get 50% signal strength on average. Usually getting around 250mbps to the router. Not worth the $75 in my opinion.",
      "This is an excellent 802.11ac wireless card. It works with OSX out of the box. On Windows, the driver situation isn't totally ideal (TP-Link isn't great about releasing drivers and their utility sucks), but there are many good third-party drivers out there for this card. The hardware appears to be high quality and it functions well.",
      "Excellent. I get perfect reception of the 2.4 GHz band and usually get around 50 MB/s download speeds (limited by Xfinity).",

      "Fantastic reliability and performance. My only real gripe is that we can't just throw one in a M.2 or PCIe slot without those extra wires coming out of the back of the case and the plastic thing you have to stick to your case that's housing the antennas.",
      "Solid connection for cheap.",
      "Never had a connection issue. Great speeds and a huge antenna",
      "It's got good long antennas, which is perfect for my use case as the computer sits a bit further from the wifi access point. Others may not need the long cable and I don't think it comes with anything else, so just note that when buying.",
      "I did have a scare during installation where my Windows wasn't recognizing the device, giving an error code that \"Device does not exist,\" but found that in addition to the specific driver that the software/Device Manager will install for this device, you also need Intel's wireless adapter driver, which was never automatically detected or recommended! Just in case anyone thinks theirs is broken. Otherwise, works just fine. Can't compare speed to other devices, but I get identical speedtest results as my iMac. Not the cheapest adapter around, but this one's got a good design with the external antenna, in which you can either lay it flat on the desk or use the included adhesive peg to hang it off the wall, rather than be stuck with antenna on the back of your tower.",
      "Wireless PCIe | 08-31-2016 | Amazon: Used a miniPCIe 7260 with a Fenvi PCIe adapter, Asus 2T2R magnetic antenna remote mount, provides 250 to 500 Mbps to a Nighthawk R7000 router. Also provides Bluetooth.",
      "Loving this wireless card so far. It is super fast and is soo much better than some of my older wireless cards. One thing to note is the bluetooth functionality that comes along with this card can only be used if you connect the cable to one of your front usb 2.0 headers on your motherboard. Doing so means you will loose the functionality of 2 of your front USB ports on your case. Not a big deal but just something to let you guys know as i did not know about it untill i was assembling the computer.",
      "This is pretty good.",
      "Great for I need it for and I've got it mounted on the wall! On the Wall Carl!",
      "Solid connection, no issues so far. Bluetooth works well too. Note that Bluetooth requires an internal connection to one of the USB headers on your motherboard, so you need to ensure your motherboard has one spare USB header. My motherboard had three USB headers and they're all in use now - Two for the front of the case (1 x USB 3.1 and 1 x USB 2.0) and one for the Bluetooth connectivity of this wifi card."

      "I get a very strong and reliable connection on my pc. My room compared to the position of the router is upstairs around many different walls yet never have a problem. I also have a TP-Link Archer C8 router.",
      "It works. Speeds/Signal are what you'd expect from a $90 wifi card. I use this in combination with TP-Link's 2.4GHz 8dBi Indoor Omni-directional Antennas (TL-ANT2408CL)",
      "For the 5 minutes I had this working it was fast...however, drivers then cause computer crash and was only able to reenter windows after physical removal of card. Now when trying to reinstall, hardware not recognized. Still in the works...",
      "Since my motherboard doesn't come with a build-in WiFi, Might aswell gonna purchase the adapter.Good connection.No lags plus,really like the black PCB.",
      "I needed an adapter as my motherboard doesn't have a wifi card, and there are no ethernet ports in the space I keep my computer. I wanted TP-Link because I had purchased a router from them a little while back and it has been fantastic. Worked like a charm after installing the drivers.",
      "I honestly chose this WiFi card because it has a black PCB.",
      "Currently my router is 15 meters away and running the cable isn't possible because of cable management :) so I order this one and downloading speed is 37.8Mbps compared to wired PC Setup 38.2Mbps. No glitch or lag while playing games which is really important for me.",
      "Fast enough to max out my 100Mbps cable connection. No bluetooth like some other, lesser priced cards, so will ding it a little for that.",
      "It needs better antennas, but the stability on it is fabulous.",
      "Fast, matches the build, works. I'm using a cat5e cable hooked up to my router so I don't use it, but it does work."

      "Not too happy with it, i get dc pretty often losing the ip and have to use win troubleshoot to get it back, or disable/enable. Wanted to punch it a few times and buy another one, still thinking about it lol.",
      "Not working with Win10.",
      "Idk what to say lol",
      "Has worked perfectly for me.",
      "I got this wireless adapter as the room where I am keeping it is quite far from our router, and this particular one had an extension, so I can put it higher up to get faster signal. It worked plug and play in windows 10 without drivers. I get around 25 MB/s, compared to around 29 on wired, which I think is quite good considering that it's around 30 metres and in a different room from the router.",
      "Stable performance and a nice look. Cheap as well.",
      "Works fine for me, I get around 5mb/s everytime I download something on Steam. Allowed me to write this review on my computer without it dying on me."
