      "Good headset, but it feels super tight on me and it does hurt my ears after a while",
      "Sounds great",
      "Good sound quality and comfort.",
      "If your sensitive to sibilant sounds then I wouldn't recommend this one because it seems to boost those S and T sounds for \"hearing important audio cues\". I mean it helps, but it makes listening to anything else harsh and unpleasant to listen to. Unless you plan to play around with the EQ, its a no go.",
      "The mic boom (foam piece) causes my mic to cut out frequently. Other than that it is great. You can remove the foam piece easily.",
      "Still to this day one of the better gaming headsets.\nCompetent Alternatives are: HyperX Cloud 3, Sennheiser x Drop PC37X, Sennheiser x Drop PC38X, Sennheiser Game ONE, Audeze Maxwell, Coolermaster MH751 & MH752.",
      "One of the best headsets you can get. Save your money for other components or games and just get this, it's great. (Try to find a Kingston version if possible; word is that the HP version of this headset isn't quite as good, but I can't personally confirm this from experience).",
      "Great headset, it’s lasted me years. The ear pads start to chip away over time like most, and I unplug it from its controls constantly but besides that it’s a pretty good headset.",
      "Pretty decent headset for the price. I like the metal frame that hasn't broken down and being able to switch between USB and aux cable is nice. My main complaint is that after years of ownership, the fake leather stuff is breaking down and shedding black stuff on me. I wish the headband and ear covers were made of fabric, and when I get my next headset, my criteria will be \"metal frame AND cloth padding covers\".\nThe sound is amazing, and my computer volume is at 8 out of 100 because that sounds full volume to me. People on calls say the mic also sounds good.\nI would give this a 4.5 if they had half stars, but since there are no half stars, it's a four for the stupid black flakes everywhere.",
      "For the price, these still are my favorite. Been using this model since 2016."

      "Has worked for me for many years (4+) but is starting to have some wet residue come out near the cable, it hasnt done any damage yet tho and everything still works as it did when i bought it. I also got the THX and spatial audio with it and that somehow made the sound quality even better which i didnt expect.",

      "Best 'gaming' headphones I used to date. Only qualms I have on this is the subtle vibration it produce. Research says it's probably coming from its Active Noise Cancelling feature.",
      "Is it possible to sound better than real life? These things manage to. They are amazing and I use them all the time. With the battery that lasts forever and another battery that's ready, that's a 15 second \"charge\" for 30 hours of battery life. The battery takes ~1 hour to charge in the GameDAC. Software is great and helps a lot. The best part is the functionality though. You can have 2 computers, 2 bluetooth devices, and an AUX device all playing audio through the headset at the same time with no issue. My setup is have it used with my computer, playing instant mic feedback, and connected to my phone if needed for a call, all playing at once.",
      "Overall I really like this headset! I've used the Arctis line before and when I did I had one main issue. I would often start feeling pain in my head from wearing the headset too long, and because of that I was hesitant to get another Arctis headset. However having had some time with this new headset, I am very pleased to say that I have had 0 head pain (and minimal headphone hair). At times I even forget that they are on my head.\nI like the design of the dock, though I would have preferred a little more weight to it to allow for easier use. However, the weight is still useable where it is.\nOne of the main issues I would hear about this headset was the audio drivers inside rubbing against ones own ear. I have experienced that specific issue but have noticed a possible solution (I have not fully tested it yet. I've found that when i feel it on my ear all I need to do is rest the ear cups higher on my ears and the problem is gone.\nAll in all, I feel that for the price tag there should be a few improvements. However I am still very pleased with the design!",
      "Worth every penny imo. The bluetooth and battery charging in the base means it will basically never end up dead and I never miss notifications on my phone. Noise cancelling is amazing, so is the transparency mode. It's definitely not cheap, but it feels very premium and is definitely worth the money.",
      "Perfection",
      "NEVER DOWNLOAD STEELSERIES SOFTWARE OR UPDATE THE FIRMWARE.\nI wish I could give these headphones 5 stars because the headphones themselves are perfect to me. However, SteelSeries and their customer service are nowhere deserving of even this 4 star review.\nMy original pair was bricked because of a firmware update. Neither the software or Windows would recognize it as a playback device anymore and there is no solution. On top of that, their customer service just does not care. I ordered a replacement through Amazon and marked mine as defective. I wiped everything SteelSeries from my PC before setting them up and will never touch their software again. This pair works just fine now.\n(Coming from Logitech G Pro X Wireless, I will no longer use these - in fairness, great - headphones because of their poor build quality) I'm no audiophile, but these headphones sound great. They feel great on my head and the ANC is wonderful because I game in my bedroom, where my girlfriend also lives and games. On top of that, I sit right next to our standalone AC unit (13900KS, 4090, and 2080 Ti in one room moment) and when sitting at my desk listening to nothing I can very slightly hear the AC, but when I have any sound going through the headphones it's history. They feel great on my head and I enjoy using them."

      "Little bit confusing to set up, but once you set it up and get the hang of it, it is absolutely amazing. Sun quality is great microphones are amazing.",
      "rlly good alrdy used it for a year on my ps4 then now im using it on my pc. Not any problems with it, rlly comfy and aesthethic, just one thing: his battery sucks",
      "its ok little overprice but amzing sound quality and calrity idk waht im talking about ask and audiophile or somin",
      "For the price it was at on sale [~$40], these headphones were, and still are, incredible. Audio sounds really good, with some nice bass, great highs, and support for Spatial Sound/3D Audio/Whatever it's called. While it does support and work with it, it doesn't necessarily change much for the audio. It's pretty subtle, but I can't ask more, especially at this price point. The built in microphone is surprisingly good — it sounds clear without a crappy distorted effect. Only downside is that it sounds like you're a bit farther away from the mic and that it picks up more background audio, but nothing that ruins it. Latency with the USB stick is nonexistent, and latency via Bluetooth is pretty small. Not too much more than via the USB stick, just around a 10ms delay. Perfectly usable. Battery life is really good. It'll last ~6 - 7hrs on a full charge, and it takes ~ 30mins to get it back up and running. If you're looking for a nice headset, I highly recommend this."

      "Battery life is poor. But surround sound and RGB and comfortable",
      "great headset but sometimes would stutter IG drivers issues",
      "Sound quality is meh overall, but the location of the surround sound is very precise. Mic is fine but sometimes doesn't feel like unmuting when you turn it on.\nBy far the worst thing though, is the occasional cut outs and the fact that you can't get sidetone/monitoring without iCue. Since iCue bricks my keyboard I deleted it and now I can't hear myself when I talk and it sucks.\nI used to have Logitech G933s. They were better.",
      "Surround sound is good. Battery life not so much. I like everything to be red RGB so only lasts like 12 to 18hrs. so i have to charge them every 2 to 3 days. Fabric is quite airy to keep you cool when gaming. and Mic is ok. may replace mic with a Audio technica At2020 though. Good for spotify I like the presets and sound good. Only have them on 20 - 30 volume because they are quite loud.",
      "you have to get a position on the head so they don't feel like they are about to fall off but nothing too difficult, the microphone sounds good, clearly being headphones the bass has a disadvantage over the other sounds when it is very loud but you don't feel it unless you use a preset that has them very loud, they sound good and clear.",
      "great feel and sound is decent for gaming. but music lovers might want to tune the bass.",
      "These headphones work, and that is the only nice thing I have to say about them. The audio quality is disappointing, although it will suffice for most tasks. The mic also automatically mutes when you flip it up, which seems like it would be a nice feature, but in reality, it often mutes even when it is fully down, and can cause lots of confusion and frustration when you think your friends can hear you, but you've just been talking to yourself for the past five minutes.",
      "I litterally have two pairs of these. Need I say more,",
      "good sound, rgb, and build quality. not very used to the feel of headphones",
      "Great sound with a very nice ability to just flip up the mic to mute. The sounds made while adjusting settings from the headphone aren't the greatest, and the battery really could be better."

      "Definitely a good investment, Best headset I've worn, Good sound quality, 10/10 would recommend.",
      "I got them for £83 and I am not a headset expert but it sounds really good and it is comfortable! Good 3D sound!",
      "Battery is way too weak. It could be a 5/5 if it lasted more than 12 hours",
      "Good sounding headphones and while there are better ones out there hard to compete with these at the sub $100 price. Plenty comfortable and good build quality",
      "This headset has been a bit of a mixed feeling for me. Have had it for a year, and it's already kind of dying. The volume dial has caused the left side of my headset to be louder than my right, and I can fully rotate it infinitely without it blocking me, which causes the audio to warp a bit. The microphone is nice, I've recorded music with it and my voice is clear in games and voice chat. I bought the version that came out before the braided cable, which has absolutely ****** me off. The cable twists on its own and wraps around itself and it is very annoying when you're expecting to get a few extra meters and then almost get slammed to the ground by the twisted cable. Headset sits comfortably, but would probably invest in a loose microphone & headset combo next. Of course, the way you use it definitely affects it, but I've only had it in my computer, and from regular use without moving it, the cable has already stripped from the plastic at the base and is now just an exposed wire. Quite disappointing quality to find from Logitech. G-hub is also disappointing software that doesn't really change much for you, although it's improved from a few years ago, it's still not what I look for in headset software.",
      "Could not be happier. Sound is great, mic is great, comfort is great.",
      "Comfy work and play headset. I might not be using the \"7.1\" part of this headset properly because I'm not sure how to set up the Logitech software, Windows settings and game settings to its full potential. I use the fabric cups. The audio and (removable) microphone quality is good (I am not an audiophile). The hardware and general build quality is top-notch, and I really like the machined aluminium discs on the sides.",
      "The best pair of headsets I've ever had.",
      "Stylish and amazing sound quality plus the Logitech g software ain’t half bad."

This is useful for me at work as I can have Teams etc running from my machine whilst also streaming music from my phone. Sound quality is good, but not on the level of 'proper' headphones. Mic is similar - perfectly serviceable but not class-leading in any way. SteelSeries software is excellent, though, and for a multi-purpose device (i.e. I can use it for work, for music, for games, and sometimes two of those things at once) it's hard to beat at this price point."

      "I didn't honestly think that there would be any sort of sound field to these headphones, given their price and look, and for a while I was content with the moderate sound, even through USB. However, when I finally downloaded and used the Logitech G HUB application, the features of the headset opened up and I was actually pretty impressed with the sound-field, and sound itself. For the price, I'm pretty happy with them (and also glad they don't have RGB.) I do wish that there had been a prompt when plugging them into USB for the first time that there was an app, or driver for them.",
      "I've had these for a long while. Definitely the best budget headset I've owned.",
      "The G432 headset is pretty nice. Don't notice the surround sound heaps. Got it cheap. Wouldn't pay more than I did. Flip to mute mic is very useful. Decently comfortable. The Razer Kraken headset is more comfortable and cheaper but the sound on these are a better.",
      "Better than any wireless headset. Great for wired and for $40.",
      "Pros: good sound, effective surround sound, and the LGHUB customization is nice too. The mic quality is great and can block out almost all background noise.\nCons: you will have to connect through USB for LGHUB to recognize it. Headset comes with an adapter for usb though. The top headrest is too thin and can be uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time.\nWould recommended this to a friend.",
      "Minus 1 star because after an hour or longer the thin top part of the headset that rests on your head causes discomfort. This is because the cushion is thin, not even the width of my thumb. Otherwise they are a good headset",
      "little pricey",
      "Great Headset for the price! These headphones are pretty lightweight for a gaming headset which makes it really comfortable for long periods of time gaming. I like the sound quality of these and the 7.1 surround sound feature really makes it feel worthwhile. The mic quality is also pretty good as I can hear myself clearly when chatting with friends on discord. Overall would recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of headphones.",
      "Sound good surround sound, comfortable. Only downside is cable is kind of short, and also not braided, so it feels weak and frail, works good with Logitech G「GAMING」App or whatever. Microphone sounds acceptable and also has a setting where you can hear your voice while you speak in the 「GAMING」g logitech app.",

      "Best headphones there are. Rocking these since 2017.",
      "Can't go wrong with these. Pair them with a powerful enough DAC and you're laughing.",
      "The sound quality on these is insane, when paired with an amplifier and DAC you can really unlock there full potential. They are open back so I was originally worried that my microphone would pick up on some of the noise that can escape through. However that was not the case. They are high quality, comfortable and allow your ears to breathe as well as hear :) 10/10",
      "Lovely sound stage, fairly easy to drive despite being 250 ohms, I prefer open back as it reduces my anxiety of being hemmed in, so these are perfect for me. Easily comfortable to wear for long periods of time, along with the twisted cable being convenient for table use.",
      "big fan of open-ear headphones, these are very comfortable and have an amazing audio quality",
      "Best headphones IMO for gaming, and my motherboard is powerful enough to run these without needing a more powerful amp.",
      "So many details, so it's good for mixing. However, the high frequencies are boosted which bugs me a bit and can be tiring after a long session. I'd say the bass is flat and the mids are a bit down. Typical V-shaped tuned headphone.",
      "Let's start with the most important things. These are 250 ohm open back headphones. By design they won't block out noise and they need at least a moderately powerful amp to drive them. Try to use them in a loud room or drive them with a standard headphone jack from a phone, laptop, or even the front panel I/O of most desktop computers and you'll be disappointed.\nUse them in a quiet room with an amp that has the power to drive them and they're incredible.\n\"Mount Beyer\" is definitely present - the brightness associated with most Beyerdynamic headphones is absolutely a thing, but to my ears this is only a problem if you're using an equalizer or other processor (like Creative's SBX sound processor). Use one of these and the brightness is almost piercing and uncomfortable. HOWEVER, if you turn off the equalizers and sound processors and drive the headphones directly, with audio that has no \"surround effect\" or \"audio enhancers\" applied, these are easily among the best sounding headphones I've ever experienced.\nI think that the problem with things like Creative's SBX or other audio processors designed to \"enhance\" sound is that they almost invariably boost the same rage where these headphones already have fantastic response. Just use a flat EQ with no additional processing and let the headphones do their thing. You'll be glad you did. The soundstage is expansive and everything comes through beautifully - the sound from these is wonderfully detailed and clear. Well worth the cost of entry.\nAs far as comfort and other matters, the large ear cups rest comfortably without crushing your ears and the open back means they breathe well so they don't get hot. Even with glasses they don't get uncomfortable even after a long listening session.",
      "The 250ohm version of this really needs to be connected to an amp so I added a Schiit stack to my build. These headphones are wonderful. I came from a wireless SteelSeries Arctis 7 and I just couldn't stand the popping and random disconnects anymore. A friend talked me into going with a real audio solution instead of defaulting to \"gaming supplies\" and it was the best decision I ever made. The open back profile of this headset is extremely immersive and makes everything you're playing feel like open world. I use these as my daily drivers for everything but music.",
      "Awesome headphones for gaming and music listening. Pairs great with an Olympus 2-E10K Dac. Soundstage is super wide too which is ideal for gaming."

      "I really like this headset but I'm taking off one star due to needing to have the Logitech G HUB app open at all times in order for the settings to stay in effect after the device is switched on and off.\nI put off getting a proper headset for a long time because ones I had used before would always hurt my ears or feel like they were squeezing my head. This headset is comfortable for long periods of time. I like that it has softer fabric over the foam instead of that fake leather stuff that sticks to your skin and always ends up fraying.\nThe mic stick is detachable, and it is somewhat flexible allowing you to bend it to be closer to your mouth. I haven't heard how the mic sounds on the other end myself- I wouldn't expect a headset mic to be amazing but at least I don't have to yell for my friends to hear me in discord, and that is all I need.\nI'm not super picky about sound quality but I can tell that the headset is a step up from my wireless earbuds, and it has just enough sound canceling to improve my gaming experience without making me completely deaf to what is going on around me.\nIf you want the two RGB areas to cycle through the rainbow while showing different colors like the headset does out of the box, you will need to set them to separate rates of change in G HUB, otherwise the color will sync. I personally do not notice the lights in my peripheral vision unless I turn off all the lights in the room besides my headset and monitor. I don't care much about the lights though, the reason I chose this headset was for comfort and the lights are just a bonus feature. I like that they turn red to indicate the battery is low, but you can also check the battery level by lightly tapping the power button.\nIt may be worth noting that my head is smaller than average, so folks with larger heads than mine might be less comfortable than I am. Also, I saw another review here where the person said they could hear the signal of the device communicating with their computer for RGB changes, but that has not been an issue for me and I have pretty sensitive hearing (I can hear high pitched noises from certain electronics that others can't hear) but it may be something to be mindful of if you are SUPER sensitive.",
      "The GOAT headset. 30 hours of battery (RGB off), no head ache from long use and amazing sound. 11/10",
      "I must say this headset is great, it's so comfortable, it has a high quality of wireless connection, and it's really easy to use. The software however, is absolute trash. If you plan on the headset's RGB, don't bother. It will beep in your brain endlessly. This headset doesn't have builtin memory, and so it transfers a frequency for each setting, and you can hear that. It's terrible. Just turn off the RGB. Aside from that, it's really comfortable. Luckily I don't care for RGB, but it is pretty annoying in Linux that I have to use stuff like OpenRGB to turn it off. Also you must turn off the headset in order to have the RGB off if the PC is off (which is an advantage imo)",
      "Great headset not much to say but if you where glasses this is for you",
      "Super duper comfortable and doesn't have any of that fake leather that withers over time. Has this nice weave and elastic head band that feels amazing. 10/10.",
      "Gonna be real, this thing sucks.\nPros: The range is pretty good. I can walk downstairs with this on and it'll stay connected... sometimes... it's inconsistent. Its pretty comfy... until it isn't. That's about all.\nCons: The sound on this thing is crap. The rgb is always in your peripheral vision so it makes focusing really difficult when they're on ESPECIALLY if you wear glasses. The head strap starts to dig into your head after having it on for a couple hours. Sometimes it'll play really ear piercing crunchy noises in your ears before disconnect randomly. The mic on it sucks. This thing costs way too much.\nPlease seriously consider any other headset than this one.",
      "Awesome",
      "A premium price, but it goes a very long way. The suspension band makes it feel like there's practically nothing resting on your head. Ear pads are memory foam. You can comfortably wear this headset for hours. The RGB is really cool and even though you can't see it all the time, c'mon, you take selfies don't you? ;)",
      "Pretty decent wireless gaming headphones, decent quality, they feel a bit cheap but they are so what can you do. I wanna get some dt 990's or something of that quality in the future, but I find myself being the one to hear footsteps better than my friends in game so these are great bang for the buck, they're logitech, they're good.",
      "Great wireless headphones take a little bit to get use to."

      "God tier headphones using its software you can make it only pick up words not background noise also it",
      "my only complaint about this headset, is that there is no real battery indicator, just high, medium, low and really low. like how do you not have a feature that bluetooth headphones from like 10 years ago or more had.\nanyways, its still amazing. Like it is a really great headset.\nOne of the best mic quality in a wireless headset, comfortable, nice EQ options, detachable microphone, usb C, replaceable ear cushions, dedicated mute button, dedicated volume wheel that actually controlls windows volume, (older corsair headsets still sold use their own volume seperate from windows, its terrible) battery is alright i guess, like 20 hours or so? i just leave them plugged in overnight like every few days it's not really a huge deal to me.\nthe cushions on mine fell apart after like 2 years of use, but i also sweat a ton, and i ordered a new set from corsair for like just 14 US dollars, took like 5 days to get here, easy to replace, and now its like brand new again.\nIt's a great headset, don't see myself replacing these anytime soon. also great for VR .",
      "Glitching out on me.",
      "DOA, and if you even touch it, it connects.",
      "These are beautiful, comfortable, sound great, and the microphone is awesome. Voice feedback when the mic and/or voice feedback is on or off is very handy. Once you get the settings tweaked they sound amazing, some of the best sounding headphones I've had.",
      "I had a SteelSeries Siberia 800. Used it for about 2 years. Problem was the rotating part of the left earcup broke, as it was only made out of plastic. Tried to fix it with superglue, didn't work. I hear loud static unless I fiddle with that broken part.\nSo I was looking for a new SteelSeries headset, but they're all sold out from the sellers I trust. Then I found out about the Corsair Virtuoso from Linus Tech Tips and Hardware Canucks.\nAluminum frame is pretty sturdy. But just like the Youtubers say, it's too tight. Then again, if my experience with my Siberia 800 were any indication, give it about 3 weeks at least, and the headband should loosen up.\nThe sound is alright, after tweaking the equalizer from Corsair iCUE software. Corsair's virtual surround sound is weird for music, but in games it did surprisingly well. I was playing Prey (2017) prior to getting these headphones, and now with them on, even if I can't see some flying robot, I could tell when it was flying above me. I could tell when it was closing in and when it was directly above my head. The sensation felt so real that the first time it happened, it made me instinctively duck my head a bit in real life.\nIf you play a lot of FPS games, consider checking out these headphones (or just headphones with virtual surround in general, if you don't like Corsair) as the ability to tell when a sound is above or below you helps a lot.\nA few problems:\nMic may not work in wired mode if you connect the USB from a USB hub. Best to connect it directly to your PC's back/front USB port. This is a common problem with devices connected to a USB hub as the hub typically only has one USB port's worth of power, so it can't give enough juice if you connect too many power hungry devices.\nWireless signal interference can happen. I turned on my Joycons wirelessly and while it was pairing, the music I was listening to stuttered, and I hear a short crackling/static sound. Supposedly, Corsair's \"Slipstream\" wireless dongle automatically switches to a less used frequency to give it the best possible connection, so maybe it will take time for it to do so the more you turn on wireless devices in your room.\nIf you have near 100% RAM usage, it starts to stutter (then again, everything in your PC will slow down with 100% RAM usage)."

There is definitely a drop in sound quality vs both of my wired headphones, but there doesn't appear to be any noticeable latency which is nice. There is a slight hum noise that is constantly present which is slightly annoying if there is no audio playing. Mic seems decent. Battery life has been fantastic."

      "Great headphones overall, not so much good quality for music, but in games it's really doing the difference as I can hear people sneeking on me from miles away. The plug and play microphone is a must, quality is not bad if you can setup it well (you might want to boost the mic gain a bit) It works with modern 3 layers jacks so you can have both mic and audio in one jack (just plug it the the NR200P front IO and both mic and audio will work well) works with smartphones too. Or you can use the 2 jack adapter that comes in the box to split the signal for mic in and audio out. The only downside is the mic is already a bit scratched by plugging / unplugging the mic and moving it in and out of my mouth. But I hope I can change just the mic adapter if it ever broke.",

      "This is my first \"audiophile\" grade headphones and they are superb! I'm mostly a movie buff, but I also enjoy music. While my Sennheiser 598 HD's have been great for gaming, movies and music for the last 2 years, the music was meh. After countless hours reading and watching reviews of different DAC/Amps and headphones that would be great for both music and gaming, I found these, recommended by most sites, but especially Zeos.\nI cannot find a fault with these headphones. The craftsmanship is superb (German made) and the sound is stellar. They are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and are very sturdy. I wouldn't worry if they dropped on the floor. They feel that solid. They come with two sets of pads. I switched out the Balanced pair and attached the Analytical pair due to more softness and sound presentation. Paired with a good DAC/Amp ( I use The Element), they have been a real joy to listen to.\nWhen I bought them from the Musician's Friend online store they were taking forever to ship, I had paid for them with PayPal so I couldn't figure out why. I made a big mistake when I bought these. I had never ordered from Musician's Friend before and I forgot to check the reviews on them before I made the purchase. I got on the Reseller Ratings website and looked them up and I was like \"Uh Oh\" they have a 1 out of 10 review rating. I thought \"damn I'm going to get burned on this purchase\", but low and behold they finally shipped and then a few days later I received them. I was like \"Whew!\".\nBought a custom cable for them too at Mimic Cables",
      "HD650s were my previous daily drivers but the minute I tried these on, the Senns went back into the box. The initial intention was to keep the HD650 for music and beyer for the rest but the 1990s are just great at everything."

Apparently there were also sound quality issues as well, as when using the new one everyone says I also sound 100% better.",

      "Sturdy, nice quality sound, two batteries, comes with DAC and Bluetooth pairs nice with electronic that have Bluetooth.",

The DAC is really nice and the hot swapable batteries are a life saver. I never have to plug it in. The only reason it is 4 stars is it is a little pricey, even on black friday it was $270."

      "Bought as an open box and had for quite some time, and it's still kicking quite strong. Good solid headset",
      "I would say its a 4.5/5 but didn't wanna to give 4. I bought it primarily because of a sale + needed something which works everywhere (PC, Playstation, Switch) and this was perfect. It works 3 ways: through a type-c dongle (best, preferred), bluetooth (its fine so for phones its a decent) and through a jack cable (connect to devices like a wired headphone). Great packaging and plenty of cables. 7.1 surroud sound app is a possible bloatware, your choice.",
      "Great headset & audio quality for gaming. My only complaint is sometimes the USB dongle isnt recognized and I have to restart my PC to get it to work",
      "Decent headset for gaming. It has wireless connectivity through bluetooth or usb-c dongle. The sound quality is pretty nice and is pretty good to a non-audiophile. However, it sometimes fails to connect to my pc and i have to replug the dongle. The 7.1 software is pretty annoying and just more bloatware. And sometimes when on FL Studio or just gaming, the audio distorts, and this happens enough to be not just a one off event.",

      "These are great... but Sony MDR 7506's exist and I'm thinking about selling these to buy those instead. If you can buy these used or refurbished, do that. Do not pay full price for these. If you're trying to decide between these or the M40X's, get these.",
      "These have served me well. They usually come with 3 cables, a long straight one, a short straight one, and a coiled one. They also come with a quarter inch adapter. Mine didn't come with the short cable because I got it refurbished.\nI would rate these as a solid entry level to the higher end of things. They sound so good. I haven't had any issues with mine. I like the sound profile but again I'm not a snob or anything like that. I'd recommend these, but if you can afford something like a Senn you should consider that instead. These are basically what you should get if you want quality but you want to save money.",

The mic quality is pretty bad. Also lights on the headset may create glare on a glossy finish monitor buts its easy to turn off and battery life increases significantly by doing so. Great option if you have a separate mic.",

      "Great sound and is super comfortable. Lights adjustable on the iCue app, if that's your thing. The microphone is crisp and haven't heard any complaints from my buddies. Was gifted from a coworker and a major upgrade from the Steel Series Arctic 3 wired I was using forever.",
      "This headset seems to be fairly decent. I got these in March and updated them as soon as I got them with the iCUE software. The battery life is a little less than expected. As long as you remember to charge it after every couple of uses your golden. There is not an accurate battery level indicator to know what the charge is. The icon in iCUE is basically fully charged, half charged, and low battery. The range is not as far is indicated either. I get 15 feet away into my hallway in my single family home and it cuts out entirely. This is likely attributed to having the dongle plugged into the pc on the back of the PC instead of the single top port of the PC, and other wireless traffic in the area.\nI got my wife the HS80 Max, which has almost triple the battery life, and can get to our back porch (about 50 feet through wood studs and drywall.\nOverall a 4 out of 5. Battery and lower than expected range is my reason.",
      "Very comfortable, although can have a little bit of squeezing",
      "This headset is something I actually did consider returning. Right out of the box the sound is just awful. It's flat, tinny and just doesn't have any depth to it. I was further worried by this still being the case when turning on Dolby Atmos. I do think that the Corsair Void headsets have better surround sound quality overall, but after some major tweaking of EQ's and getting used to a different sounding pair of headphones, I did finally find a spot where I am happy with them. The major reason I kept on to these is that they are not as high profile as the Void series and the mic quality is actually pretty nuts for a gaming headset. You'd be forgiven for mistaking it for a standalone mic with how good it sounds. The wireless part is new to me and I really appreciate the freedom it gives, the lack of wire is worth paying for if you're not a complete sound buff who needs something like a studio headset. The distance on these things isn't great but it reaches 90% of our small rented space, I lose connection when I am at the edge of the kitchen and in the downstairs bathroom, so not awful. I do see this being a bigger issue in a full sized house. The wireless charge with lights on lasts me about 18 hours so I tend to have them on charge before they run out. Though I do take care not to leave them charging overnight as to avoid damaging the battery life.\nOverall probably not the best option out there, but certainly not the worst and I am finding myself becoming happier with them the longer I use them.\nEdit: So it is currently June 6th 2023 and I bought these on November 28th 2022. The earpads have already fallen apart, I've requested some more via the 2 year warranty but this really brings the rating down to a 3 star. The build quality of the cups is appalling for the price."

      "Good but the mic broke after like a year but bought 9 dollar replacement off of Amazon which works good",
      "is good but not real 7.1",
      "Edited cause I fixed the problem The sound is good, the comfortability is good, mic is good + it's detachable, only problem I had with it, was the USB dongle, it may be faulty, it disconnects randomly and it gets buggy with 7.1 surround sound on, they are great for BT or any other connection tough, the headphones themselves are great."

      "These sound incredible. I wanted the Cloud Alpha, but got the Cloud 2 on sale. I'm glad I didn't spend the extra. The cord is super long, and the controls are simple to use. They are extremely comfortable and don't feel cheap at all.",
      "the sound is good but I have problem with The sound is distorted, I have to disable it and enable its so annoying",
      "I'm a bit of a sound snob, but I use these since it goes with the aesthetics of the PC. The mic is mediocre and the sound reproduction is so so vs the Sennheiser's and AT2020 I daily on my main computer. But you know what it works so it gets a 3 out of 5 for me.",
      "The headset is amazing, But If you don’t care about wireless then get the non wireless one, it’s 50 bucks and some what close to this one just without 7.1 surround sound."

      "I never thought some entry level audiophile headset could beat 90% of gaming oriented headphones, but here we are, and I am completely happy with this purchase. The drivers are completely out of this world, making it amazing for games and films, but the pads are comfortable as hell. It's perfect.",
      "The golden classic. Comfortable, good sound quality, only had to replace the ear cups once and cable once so far. Have owned it for a few years now, still as good as ever.",
      "Great sounding headphones but I wish they had more clamping pressure.",
      "Way better than any gaming headset you could buy, and for the price with a v-moda microphone you'd have to spend at least $200 to get a comparable gaming headset. I've had it for 3 years and the only issue I've had was with the v-moda going kinda f*cky and playing static in one ear at certain volume levels, which was a $15 fix, and besides that the headband broke a small amount after around 2.5 years (was a quick temporary fix with hot glue), but I didn't expect this headset to last as long as it did, and for the price I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did. No wear on the ear cups or anywhere else. It's very comfortable and light, good swivel, enough headband adjustment, etc. The biggest problem for some people would be it's open back so if you live in a loud house or in a big city with trains and **** (or a loud keyboard) it could be a problem. Definitely worth it if you don't expect it to last forever",
      "Excellent pair of cans, especially when price is taken into consideration. I used to use a pair of beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro. After using open back headphones I don’t think I could go back to closed back for use in a private setting. The SHP9500s are so damn comfortable. They have great neutral sound reproduction and solid imaging. Soon after getting them I gifted the DT 770s to my pops.",
      "Fantastically flat. Little dull at the top end for my tastes, but for 70 dollars I can't really complain.",
      "This with a V-Moda boom mic is my headset of choice, cost me about 110 USD for similar performance in a gaming headset I would have to pay close to 250-300 USD.",
      "Amazing. They sound great, they're built sturdy, they're as comfortable as you can get, and they're open backs. A steal at $70. Perhaps the most attractive feature, however, is the removable cable, which lets you pair them with the V-MODA BoomPro. Together, they become a $110 headset that singlehandedly champions the argument that you should not buy a gaming headset when the SHP9500 + BoomPro combo exists.",
      "Been rocking these for a few years now. I paired it with a FOSI Audio DAC-Q4 just to give me more control over base and treble. For 70 dollars you honestly cant beat these, especially for music and content consumption!",
      "Best price to performance headphones on the market. The open back design is great. And the minimal clamping force is really nice."

      "I have previously travelled a lot and bought these headphones using frequent flyer points. This headset is another level, the noise cancellation eliminates any noise from my pc at any fan setting. I'm not an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is excellent. It has a touch panel on the side for controlling media. Have used it extensively for 1.5years at this point and the battery still lasts >12h.",

      "These headphones are the best i've ever had. I think the main feature I love is the UBR system which pretty much just makes the headphones vibrate on really hard bass, but it just makes you feel like there's a giant subwoofer sitting right next you. The microphone auto mute when you put it up is a really nice feature that I use all the time. The red accent lighting looks awesome and while it does have a switch to turn it off I keep it on all the time. The 7.1 surround sounds is awesome and works very well, I can always tell way better where someone is shooting from in a game compared to my friends."

      "Pros: Great headset, chat mix is useful, Sonar has built-in streamer mixing. I get compliments on my mic quality. The hot-swappable batteries might make the headset worth buying for that alone. In general, the hardware is top tier (with the exception of the ear cups).\nCons: Sonar/SteelSeries GG has to be running for the headset to work properly, and I swear it resets my settings every few days. It's maddening. The app has good features, but once I set things up I don't want to have to think about your stupid app and/or change my settings back every time I want to use the headset. Stop shuffling my device switching settings. Stop crashing when I use my KVM switch and killing the sound to my desktop. SteelSeries, for the love of god fix your app, or make it optional. There's a whole DAC sitting on my desk doing nothing that could be doing a lot of this stuff without forcing me to interact with your software.\nAlso, the noise-canceling is mid, and I eventually had to switch out the earcups for Wicked Cushions because the stock ones were getting pretty uncomfortable. Unfortunately, I think this did change the sound profile a bit.",

Sonar works most of the time it is a little spotty but it is great when tuning your EQ if you don't know how just search it up on youtube.

You can always find better sound quality with a wired headset, but as far as wireless options go these are great.\nVery light and comfortable even for long sessions, and the battery lasts for a very long time as well. The included microphone is passable, and the range with the dongle is great alongside the option for a wired connection.",

HD580, 600 and 650 blow any other dynamic open back out of the water, except maybe stuff like ZMF and maybe the Auroris Borealis.\nDefinitely way better than treble death headphones like dt770/990/1990/1770. those are very yucky.",

      "I'm actually using the HD-6XX from Drop, but they're identical so I put it under this because that pair isn't on here. Very good, sound is amazing, just the right level of everything. There's a reason this is the benchmark pair for headphones, and the audiophile headphone for beginners. It's easy to decide with its balanced and detailed soundscape if you want more treble/bass/etc, and to upgrade to according intermediate open-back pairs like the Sundaras or Beyerdynamic DT-990/1990 pros. For me, though, the balance was just perfect, and I don't plan on changing these out for many years. Just get an amp along with them. I went with the FiiO K7. These are also still mindblowing how good they are to me, as I went from a Razer Kraken headset to these lol. I used to like those things but they sound like absolute crap now.",

      "I came from a pair of HD598s to these, wanting something better for listening to music with while retaining the 598s for gaming. These really do live up to the hype surrounding them. Just make sure you have a dedicated amp to drive them properly.\nI should note that I bought mine heavily used and they're so well built that you could have told me they were new and I'd have believed it."

      "I threw them at my desk and snapped one of the sides off and they still work and I can use them still.",
      "They sound great, they look great, and they're super comfortable. Would have liked to have USB-C charging, though.",
      "These headphones are incredible. The RGB looks nice and pairs well with other Logitech device for a very sharp, clean look. The battery is replaceable for amazing longevity. The headphones are retractable and sound very good for a headphone mic. Has a pass-through audio so you can hear yourself better when wearing them as they damn near eliminate any other noise with their incredible noise cancelling ear muffs. The pass-through noise can be turned on and off thought the Logitech app and also stops when mic is muted to easily know if your mic is on or not. The 7.1 surround sounds incredible and is super easy to tell which direction the sound is coming from.",
      "Yea I know , Logitech again, what can I say they make good products. The customer service I have had from the company is awesome as well. I was trying to find someone selling the side magnetic covers as I wanted to get another set so I could modify mine, and I couldn't find them anywhere for sale. I contacted Logitech and to my surprise they informed me that they are not sold separately. But wait for it, ....In the mail not even a week later, Logitech had sent me a set of the magnetic covers and a spare battery as well ....For FREE.....wow, how many companies do stuff like that!!\nThese fit my head great, I have a larger head and a lot of headsets out there are just too small! They sound great, I don't get sweaty with them on , even for hours. Just very good and comfortable! been using these for about 5-6 months as well"

      "Cheapest audiophile level headset I could find at least in my research and has given me a lifechanging experience in gaming. I am never going back to wireless gaming headsets.",
      "Great value, you can expect rapidly diminishing returns by going more expensive than these headphones. Comes with a decent quality microphone as well.\nI just wish they were a bit louder, I generally have to turn the volume slider on these higher than the Logitech Pro X's they replaced. I doubt volume will be a concern for the vast majority of listeners however.",
      "Great headset, amazing soundstage. Only wish the microphone was detachable.",
      "Awesome sound, crisp and good base. The shape of the earmuffs are big and fit nicely around my ears. Even with my big head, the clamp force isn't annoying, the adjustment notches are strong and won't come lose, extra-long cable, great microphone, I love the mute mic feature. The construction feels a little chintzy, maybe because I came from a metal pair of headphones, but in reality, they still are a great set of headphones if you take care of them. I am looking forward to upgrading to a HD600.",

      "Love these headphones, I don't use the haptic feedback as often anymore, as I prefer to keep them plugged into AUX, instead of charging them every night. Also, I have a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro, which are easier to just put in my ears and go. I mainly use these when I'm in VR, as they feel pretty immersive!\n[UPDATE 2024: These headphones came in clutch during 2023. I played VR often, so having good audio was very important to me. The mic sucks bad on the headphones if you're using AUX (I believe they're more reliable using Wireless USB), so I recommend getting an external mic. If that's out of your budget, you can literally just use your phone :)]"

      "Almost Perfect Analog Headset, Superb Audio Quality, Durable Earpads. its Microphone gain is too low, which creates a noisy Mic Output paired with Budget Motherboards.",
      "Awesome pair of closed back headphones with a fantastic microphone. Sounds especially good for music and movies. The spacious sound that you might chase for gaming would be better on an open-back headset, but they still might be the best closed-back gaming headset I've ever heard.\nI give them 4 stars because the included ear cushions don't feel premium and are much too firm for my liking. If you can pick up some softer replacements such as Dekoni pads, the comfort and bass response are both improved.",
      "Used to have an HD 569 and an antlion modmic as a headset setup but I wanted a dedicated headset and this one fit my needs, it sounds very good albeit with post EQ tuning.\nOrdered: Dec 26, 2023\nArrived: Dec 28, 2023",

      "Pretty nice headset for the money. Got them for 50$ and this feels like a really nice 75$ headset but never in a million years would I pay 100$ for this, which is what I see a lot of retailers selling it for. The mic definitely feels like a 60$ headset mic so if you buy this with the intent of getting a mic to stream on Twitch with I think there are better options for less but when it comes to gaming this thing feels amazing. I love the look and feel and it is one of the first headsets that can properly fit on my head since I have an afro. Because of the detachable mic, this can easily be worn in public to listen to music with and nobody would guess it's a gaming headset which is a definite plus, just be warned the cable is mega long so I wouldn't exactly recommend that unless you have some sort of thing to store the extra cable in. Overall, definitely worth the 50$ I spent on it, wouldn't go more than 70$ though.",

The only issue I have with it is that it has audio crackling on some movies and shows when watched with MPV player. This is a problem because Plex uses this player. There are 2 workarounds: Connect headset with 3.5mm cable or route the audio through voicemeeter.",

Petty grievances aside, they look very nice and fit my head comfortably, so overall I enjoy them, but wish I would have bought them on sale.",

Yesterday, it also started connecting, disconecting, and reconecting in a cycle, but it seems to have fixed itself. idk whats going on. On further examination I have discovered that it stops working when the mic is being used by an aplication.",

The sound is a bit more metallic than I was used to initially, but after EQing and more use, this eased.\nThey are open-back, so you can hear a fair bit of ambient noise, and others can hear what you're listening to. Just be aware of that fact.\nUPDATE after 2 years: These are still the best headphones I've ever owned. They do sound even better with an amp."

      "Got these for Christmas in 2022, Have not disappointed me once",
      "Great headset, been rocking this for a few years. Mic and sound quality are great, only complaint is the driver grill touches my ears a little bit, I do wish there was just a little more room for my big ears in there.",
      "From my previous setup. These have been amazing wireless headphones. Super comfortable and they sound great. Plus the range is really good in case you need to hear your game while you make a sandwich. After about 2 years of ownership, ive started having issues with discord and the surround sound, may be a software issure but I've not found a fix for these issues. Physical condition is great even after about 3 years. Also when they are at low battery they play a tone every 30 seconds or so until you plug them in, it gets very annoying when you cant plug them in.",
      "bought used on amazon warehouse, everyone said they were garbage, but these produce highest quality sound ive ever heard. the mic is meh, but dont think you can get much better on a gaming headset",
      "Best wireless headset on the market, no contest.",
      "Took a while to get used to, love them now.",
      "Good audio quality. Comfortable once you replace the ear pads with thicker ones. Excellent battery life. Mic sounds decent and retracts into the headset. Main thing I'm looking forward to is USB Type C update and an update to make the USB receiver more compact or at least detachable from the USB cable.",
      "Good steeleries quality audio. I have been told the mic is bassy, which can be solved by moving the mic away from the mouth and nose so that you aren’t blowing directly on it.",
      "amazing sound, the mic is according to my friends \"good\". The headset also last for a long time with out charging, and when you charge it it goes fast.",
      "These are a revelation. Sound quality is fantastic... AFTER you set it up properly. I firmly suspect these things are capable of much more than the software they are shipped with will allow"
