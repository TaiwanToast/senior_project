      "Got these for a bit more than I should have paid, but I'm not upset about that. They're great for playing games that I don't need headphones for, and for watching Youtube/listening to Spotify while I do homework and such. The base is a bit iffy at times, but you get what you pay for. For the $30 I paid I'd have got something else, but for the $20 they sell for at sane retailers, they're great.",
      "CRAZY GOOD FOR 20 BUCKS! For the price they sound good and surprisingly have some good bass, not much of any sub bass but for 20 buck speakers with no sub, pretty dang good.",
      "These are really great. They look amazing, sound amazing and get really loud if you want them to.",
      "I cannot recommend these enough, they sound great. I cannot believe the low price tag.",
      "Not the best speakers in the world, but great value.",
      "Great little speakers, same audio quality if not better as my Corsair HS55 headset, pretty loud too. a little bit bigger than I thought they would be, but not really an issue. Great value for $35 AUD.",
      "Cheap, but excellent speakers that get the job done well.",
      "They're $20.....Not much to expect other than they work and have somewhat okayish sound. Which they do. Wish they were louder but....again....they're $20",
      "Excellent sounding speakers for £20, well worth it for the budget setup.",
      "The wires are not great, but the simple design and impressive sound quality make up for the cheap build quality. Definitely a must-have for any desk setup."

      "These are by far the nicest desktop speakers I've ever used.\nThe sound coming from each is crisp and vibrant. The bass is solid but won't rattle your desk or wake up your neighbours. Their clean and contemporary appearance pairs nicely with my monitor, almost disappearing behind it. Their relatively small 90 x 124 mm footprint is a big plus for me.",

The pre-amp for the headphone jack is good though, and the dial turns nice and smooth/precisely with a satisfying click when turning on/off.",

      "Great speakers for 18 dollars?!?!?!?!?!? I love these speakers. They sound and look insanely good and for only 18 bucks, they just can not be beat.",
      "One of the speakers doesn’t work I’m still trying to fix it, but otherwise that one speaker itself is really loud and has a lot of base once I get the other speed working it’s probably gonna be really good but the fact that it doesn’t come with the speaker ready and easy just to plug-in just still ruins it",
      "best budget speakers that I've had in my whole life",
      "Does the job, leagues better than my monitor's integrated speakers and better than I expected for only $30",
      "The audio sounds really good for the price, looks great, only complaint is how they are wired. I wish the wires connecting them were all detachable or replaceable, I just get concerned about them getting yanked accidentally and breaking, then you would have to order a whole new set of speakers rather than just a new cord.",
      "In general I really like these speakers. The audio and the bass are really nice and I like the small and clean design. They are also very cheap for their quality. My only point of criticism is that sometimes when the pc turns off the speakers make a low bass sound if they were still playing music. But overall I would really recommend this product.",
      "The best speakers to get for the price, only paid $20.",
      "surprisingly good for £20",

      "Great sound quality, very loud when wanted but doesn't support 192 kHz sampling rate (maximum 96 kHz) or Microsoft WMA Pro Audio audio format codec when connected via optical / SPDIF. Support until 32-bit 192kHz in classic multi-jack connectivity but you lose the performance of the internal audio decoder.\nTotally support DTS and Dolby Digital, sending DTS:X or Dolby Atmos is also decoded. Copper wires are fragile, take care of it when installing the speakers.",
      "Great sound system ( when I actually get to use it ). Good sound, really immersive ones on and running off optical lead to pc so not too much clutter. Again, had it on sale so really a great piece of kit for the money.",
      "Best compact solution for a 5.1 audio.",
      "I've been using Logitech Z5500 kit for a long time with my previous PC and its \"natural heir\" did not disappoint me at all: plenty of power, clear sound, beefy basses and a nice look - even if without any particular peak - make this 5.1 kit just ideal for gaming, you cannot find anything better for this price.",

They get really loud [although I don't recommend doing so as you'll hear that static sound once you pass a certain threshold], have a nice amount of bass and sense of depth, and look nice. Only downside to this is the fact that the wires are pretty short, so if the device you're gonna connect it to is over ~3 ft., I'd consider getting extensions or moving the device a little closer to the speakers or vice versa.",

      "They're great speakers. It's the first set of speakers I've ever owned that came with a sub-woofer, and it's pretty fun cranking it up to feel the booms in your chest cavity. It's a massive improvement on the monitor sound that the monitor I ordered has. There's no comparison to be had. Very nice speakers for a very nice price point.",

Since I put myself through college selling audio equipment, these are the ONLY speakers I found that match what I would put in my family room. The sound is incredible. Crisp highs, great soundstage, clear vocals, wide dynamic range and a subwoofer that produces clean bass notes, unlike the resonating thumps you hear from the car 2 lanes over at a stoplight.\nYou can't buy better sounding speakers for the money. They not only come from one of the pioneers of the Audio Industry, they are also one of the few speaker systems to pass the rigorous THX standards.",
      "Terrific and timeless.",

      "I do not know a whole lot about audio numbers but I can tell that these have great sound quality. Only thing that you have to do to set up that is kind of a hassle is to fit the ends of those wires for the 2 speakers into the sub woofer which acts as the main power supply. The subwoofer is amazing to have by the way.",
      "Awesome speakers. Wish I could give more input but I’m not really a audio guy🤷🏾‍♂️",

I ended up going with the Cyber Acoustics CA-3810 speakers for $67, thinking that I might as well save $40 because there can't be that much difference, right? I WAS SO WRONG. The CA speakers were \"cheap\" looking and sounding- which one should probably expect for $67 -but it just wasn't going to cut it. I returned them and bought the Klipsch instead. Holy cow, worth every penny. Let's just say one of my favorite things to do now is fire up a THX sound test video on YouTube and blow myself away.",
      "I'm a rookie audiophile. I got this 2.1 set on clearance for $70 at walmart. I'm very happy with them. The LED is tooooo bright and the speakers pop when power cycled so I have to leave them on at all times else I worry something will break. I just really like the style of this set too. Subwoofer works great for me. Easy to set up, just make sure to plug that old school vga-type cable from the right speaker into the subwoofer, then plug the one green wire into your PC's speaker/headphone jack and you're good to go.",
      "Loud and clear, dont mess up right and left like me",
      "Picked up these bad boys up for around 90$ on sale and holy cow they are absolutely incredible. They can go LOUD. The base is very punch and they do not feel like they are lacking anything in any area. I would recommend these to absolutely anyone. I work with Studio One a lot and so far I have been very impressed. The biggest con is that they are always on unless you unplug them all the time - which you should not do. Other than that these are fantastic. I use these speakers with a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy Rx 24-bit 192 kHz Sound Card and the sound is crisp and the base is punchy. I reccomend."

      "Great speakers, sound nice and look good.",
      "Really good speakers. Still with us all the way since 2018!",
      "I absolutely love this 2.1 system. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really tell much from a sound quality point of view (but I know it's definitely good enough for me), but the lighting is where it shines. Unmatched decoration potential, gorgeous bright effects that can shine and reflect off the wall behind the desk. I would not swap this for anything else out there.",
      "Really nice sound quality.",
      "I'm not an audiophile so these speakers have met all my expectations and no complaints.",
      "Sounds good for the price point, and has RGB, what's not to like?",
      "After the latest update the subwoofer level is controlable so we can go boom!\nHave not had the same G-hub issues as many many others so pretty happy.",
      "For the money, this was a great deal. The RGB looks nice against the wall, especially when playing music. The speakers are a real upgrade to the TV when I can use them and the subwoofer provides more than enough bass for my music tastes. Will update once I game a bit, to give an honest appraisal on explosions and related effects.",
      "Good speakers, the right satelite speaker buzzes a bit, but it has mostly gone away, it only happens for a few seconds every couple of weeks now. There is a glitch where the rgb backlight on the speakers turns off after ~20 mins of no sound output (even when the \"turn off rgb after user inactivity\" option is off), but I discovered that having Logitech g hub installed and then installing Logitech gaming software seems to have fixed it.",
      "Love the quality of these speakers, super loud and packs a punch. At max volume you cannot sit in the same room as them as its so damn loud and yet the sound quality is not lost. The base makes the whole house shake and the slimulated 7.1 sounds fantastic. The RBG is gorgeous and pairs super well with other Logitech devices."

They have EQ settings and essentailly sound staging built in, so you can really dial in the sound for whatever you're listening to. Podcasts, video games, movies, music, you can adjust it to make each of these pop in just the right way. For the price, these are some of the best speakers I've ever used."

I tend to keep these monitors plugged in even when gaming (mostly because getting up to switch them on and off all the time is annoying, but hey - they’re active monitors - so it’s required!) - which is fine if you’re use to a flat EQ."

      "They are active speakers, so make sure that's what you want before buying these. They don't seem to like being plugged to my computer. They sometimes stop working for no reason, and I have to reboot for them to behave again. They make a click when sound starts playing. They perform great when they are not acting up, and they weren't expensive, so I'm keeping them. I would have replaced them if I was using them for work, and not just gaming.",
      "Received as a Christmas gift. Great all round speakers for gaming, music, netflix. These are plugged into my PC via digital audo cable and my work laptop via AUX. Additionally my phone is connected via Bluetooth.",
      "Picked these up for about 40 euros, and I absolutely love these speakers. They look great, sound quality is amazing, and has bluetooth, coax and optical, couldn't ask for anything more",
      "Nice speakers, unique look. Voice not as clear as PreSonus Eris."

      "On first setup, I was disappointed, but the neat thing about having an optical port on this system (and that's the only reason to buy these speakers) is you can run THX Spatial and Dolby Atmos for headphones through it, and in fact you can do both at the same time!\nWith a bit of software help they sound crisp and lively and suddenly become excellent value. (Seriously give those bits of software a try, free trials are available on both)\nThese are essentially just above average PC speakers, if you want better, buy Dolby Atmos, and pay the premium that entails.\nOh and they are too bass heavy, first thing any sane person will do setting them up is turn down the bass by 30-40%.",

Bass is extremely DEEP! Amazing full sound that fills the entire room can be heard throughout the entire house in low setting.",

      "Decent sounding speakers for the price. However, in my opinion in certain music genres, the subwoofer overpowers the speakers, and on my unit sometimes the right side speakers stops working, until I crank the volume to a high level for a split second, and then it starts working properly, until you turn off the speakers.",

      "Great to jam out to Spotify or in game. Nice bass sound. At just above 100 dollars, does everything I want it to do and then some.",
      "Big heavy bass subwoofer causes the bass in any noise to be very loud and immersive. great if you are going for a brown and black colour scheme and since owning it and the easy to use volume controls i could never go back without having it. dont touch the speakers after touching it as the logo part is a fingerprint magnet and as other speakers dont press the cone in as they will never come back out.",

These speakers are definitely way nicer than the ones I had before and the sound isnt bad. Do not expect studio sound quality from these guys, but they are still really good.",

      "very loud and the sub gets nice and deep. almost too loud but thats why i got it. great for the price",
      "Owned these for a few years now, Solid little unit.",
      "Picked this up secondhand for only $9.99 and even at four or five times that price it offers great sound - the tiny subwoofer set near your feet under a desk can be cranked up to produce a toe-tickling rumble that's surprisingly strong for its size.\nA particularly nice feature is that it evenly mixes the signal from up to three inputs, including a male 3.5mm, a female 3.5mm and a stereo RCA, so it's perfect for a multi-monitor, multi-machine setup and makes it easy to layer music from the collection on your mobile phone over the sound effects from your first-person shooter.\nAnd if you're family or your roommate starts to complain about the din, there's a 3.5mm headphone jack right alongside the volume knob.",
      "Only way to make this system better in my opinion would be to have a smaller profile but keep the loud and crisp sound signature"

      "Absolutely THE BEST speakers for general use on pc. They have an exceptional audio quality, you can just FEEL the bass at higher volumes. The build quality is also amazing, as they (so far) have lasted 8 years for me, and I have yet to have a problem with them! It's just a shame that Bose no longer sells it (to my knowledge). Overall, this is a 10/10 product, and I recommend anyone with a budget of around $100 to buy it on eBay.",

      "Work for me!",
      "Great sound quality. The bass is very impressive for no subwoofer.",
      "Beautiful sound quality. I got mine for $80 two years back and they're as good as new still.\nUpdate Oct 2019: Going on a little over three years with these bad boys and I still love them. I'd HIGHLY recommend a pair. Might seem crazy due to the price, but I am very picky about audio quality and find myself nothing but completely satisfied by these. If you're a bass head, the bass is fairly decent at full crank, although it's not going to match a sound bar or an actual subwoofer (which should be obvious considering they're pretty small speakers). There aren't any pre-amp outs on these, but I'm sure you could figure out a workaround... if you so desired.\nPro tip (since I didn't mention this in my original review): there is a black mesh cover that comes with these speakers if you're not into the yellow. That makes them a whole lot more enjoyable for me, personally, as my setup is mainly black.",
      "Old school, simple and punchy. When you're in headphones most of the time then having a simple fallback is always handy.",
      "Unfortunately I don't have space to bring these two wonderful ladies with my in my new home, 'cause I'm taking with me 2 big-fat-KRK monitors.\nI love this 2.0 system so much, it has a balanced sound and basses are great, so you don't need to place a stupid large subwoofer (2.1 systems) around your desk.",
      "great budget speakers if you already have nice headphones but want speakers for your setup just in case you have friends over",
      "Awesome pair of speakers for the money.",
      "They're good enough. I have a 5.1 system for my consoles, so this isn't as good as that obviously, but still miles better from the speakers on my retiring laptop. Happy with the purchase as they also look wicked.",
      "Pretty underwhelmed by the sound quality, to be frank. I own pretty good earpieces, so probably too used to that. The bass is pretty muddy, so if you listen to bass heavy music, don't expect much."

      "Great looking, great sounding speakers. I love the compact form factor, matches my itx pc perfectly. They get pretty loud, and the bass is decent considering the size of the driver. I did add a 12\" sub though, for movies mostly, but some times I turn it on for gaming as well. The only thing I'd change would be to have a way to cut the lower frequencies out so I can turn on the sub and crank these up louder. Overall I'd buy them again though"

      "I bought this pair of speakers back in 2015, and they have been wonderful ever since. I went with M-Audio because I had just gotten an M-Audio midi controller shortly before these speakers and was impressed by the quality of the product. Doing some research led me to these, and they've never really disappointed me.\nLetting them run for a few hours will inevitably make them warm up, but they never get HOT. I've left these things on overnight multiple times, and I always cringe at wasting power and possibly running the lifespan of the speakers down. But even after hours of running, they still stay a very reasonable temperature, and don't develop any noticeable problems with audio fidelity.\nWhen I was on older laptops & desktops, I would get a speaker buzz due to ground loop. I think this is less the fault of the speakers themselves, and more a result of the power supply of the computer or laptop (i.e. not the PSU, but the actual circuit you're plugging into at the wall), and the unique audio hardware of each different computer. Your mileage may vary, but I had used a \"Ebtech Hum X Voltage Hum Filter\" from Amazon, and it cured all my ground loop buzz problems with these speakers and my set up in general.\nLittle blue LEDs are located between the tweeter and the main driver to indicate when they're on. These LEDs are bright. I put black duck tape over them for a few days when I was watching movies from bed and the only lights in the room were the computer monitor and these speaker power lights. It just bugged me mildly. It's not the kind of bright that's painful to look at, but these blue LEDs could distract from the overall aesthetic of your build or your desk set up, especially if blue clashes with your color scheme.",
      "Love these speakers. Had them since 2012.",
      "Great sound quality for the price."

      "great sounding desktop speakers with bluetooth.",
      "Expensive, but hard to beat for their size and build quality.\nThe sound quality is fantastic and I've never heard anything of this size sound this good. Don't expect them to get close to a proper set of 5\" or 6\" bookshelf speakers, but in my opinion the sound easily beats anything that Logitech or Creative sell at this size. They can easily blast music in a small/medium room, and they're great for gaming at your desk.\nBuild quality is also fantastic. The speakers come out of the box looking perfect. They have a very dense feel to them, and the paint finish is perfect all the way around. The volume knob (while inconveniently on the back) feels fantastic.\nMy main gripe with the speakers is the lack of a dedicated remote or controls to switch between inputs (it's just done automatically). This means you can't specifically turn Bluetooth off, or disable the USB input. For my use case (just using RCA) it isn't a problem though.\nIf you can grab these on sale I think it's worth it, but you might be able to match the sound quality with something like a Steelseries Arena. If you want something that looks fantastic on your desk, go no further."

      "These speakers are just OK in almost every respect. The price is OK, the sound quality is on the lower-end of OK, the volume is OK. These are about as middle-ground as a 5.1 speaker set for a PC can get, and that's OK.",
      "Ok , yea Logitech again, bought this on sale as well. These speakers have a lot of sound, Wow do they blast. I will never have a problem with not hearing my game or music again, that is for sure. Comes with 5 speakers and a sub. I am only using 3 speakers and the sub, they still kick a lot of sound. Originally bought these to test them out and was going to move them to my living room tv for the better sound and surround sound. Yea that was the original plan, they are still at my computer, and they are staying. The tv will have to wait for another set or something else. ...LOL",
      "Great speakers for the price. Perfect for a small room/gaming area when youre not trying to wear headphones.",
      "Price dropped on these one day so I bought. I wanted a 4 speaker and sub system minimum for games and something to play music reasonably well. This seemed to be a good option in the research I did. So these sound amazing for a PC speaker I have to say. The sub is small but does well for that size, the frequency response is better than I expected. The sub level is on the sub which could be a hassle. They look cool, they perform great. I think you could use these for HT use in a smaller room. They get loud in a roughly 12' square room I have them in now, not blow you out the door loud, but loud for little speakers and can be heard on other end of house. They hook up with PC sound cables (included, grn/blk/ylw) or RCA, so no digital. Front right has power, volume, led, and a larger rs232 looking cable to the sub.",
      "One of the more inexpensive sets of surround sound speakers you can get but surprisingly good sound for the price. The main speaker containing the volume knob oddly enough uses an RS-232 serial connector rather than USB. They do start to crackle slightly at high volumes.",
      "'Tis a great speaker system",
      "Bought this after trading $140 worth of dora the explora nintendo games to JBHIFI and after 4 years, its still running like a champ. Audio quality is superb and amazing.",
      "I have had this speakers for over 2 years, and i have to say....They are still going strong! Besides getting some static from the speaker cause of near electronics, this speakers are just loud, is great! Only thing thing i don't like is that there is no Aux, so you can't use it to listen to music from your phone. I had some cheap ones back then that weren't good as this but at least it had an Aux. Though i can forgive them because the bass in this is too much, literally i barely have it half way and i can feel it the bass hard. Every speaker can also be tweaked so that each one plays a different instrument from the song, and when it syncs is just perfect!",
      "This was referred to me by my cousin who got this set refurbished from Best Buy, I went out, tested, and bought it brand new. I haven't had a problem, and now with the games that I could play the 5.1 is better than any stereo system. I highly recommend this, it's a cheap way to get the most out of gaming. I do strongly suggest however to keep the bass to a minimum, it's still a very powerful system.",

      "GOOD\nLess space than Premium speakers\nVery good gaming/music quality\nBAD\nNone",
      "Amazing punch for it's footprint. No room for speakers, no problem. I'm amazed by the sound quality and volume of the soundbar.\nFriends are always surprised when I play music or a game on this, as the bass punches, and the mids and highs are clear and not muddy.\nOh, it also has RGB!",
      "Update: Do not buy this sound bar. It has a constant crackle/pop static noise with Windows 10 that won't go away. Creative's software support is also nonexistent. Save your money and go with Logitech or some other company with better support instead of just taking your money and ignoring your issues.",
      "I don't know how I lived without a soundbar and sub when I was younger playing PC games. This is probably my favorite piece for gaming (and my girlfriend's least favorite). Playing doom eternal with the speakers blaring slaying demons is such a rush. Highly recommended. Also connected to my ps4.",
      "Great 2.1 audio setup. It will cost you but it is the best PC soundbar on the market."

      "I fell in love with these the minute i tried them, best speakers I have ever used.",

      "great product, good connectivity and good looking.",
      "These speakers are awesome, and the increased cable length over 2.0 speakers makes it a must have!",
      "Great computer speakers! Sound quality is really good, and I actually find myself using these more often than my headset!",
      "Very nice upgrade from Logitech's Z200 speaker setup. Definitely provides the bass quality and oomph that I was looking for! It also comes with much greater cable lengths, and the little volume knob looking device in the middle, sits well below my main monitor for easy on/off and volume adjustments.",
      "Sound quality, bass, ease of use, etc. all perfect. For computer speakers, these sound absolutely crisp, with bass that reverberates all around the room. Audio enthusiasts should definitely look into these."
