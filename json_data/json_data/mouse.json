      "The goat!",
      "Got this is a gift for Christmas and it's awesome! Upgraded from a cyberpower cheapo mouse that came in my previous pre built. There are so many buttons on this thing, you will find a use for whatever you want somewhere on this noise.\nIt's not perfect though. First, some of the buttons depress way too easily and if you have functions assigned to them (or haven't changed from the default), you're gonna press them on accident. Second, at default, they assign and TON of shortcuts on this noise and they're only adjustable through Logitech's G hub. Thirdly, the worst button is right underneath the scroll wheel that switches your mouse between SIX DIFFERENT PROFILES. It's so easy to press with the pad under your knuckles and doesn't make a noise when you do. I had a shortcut set up and pressing the profile button kept switching different profiles and none of my keys worked. Best way to fix this is completely unassign the button and use it elsewhere. Lastly, the scroll wheel itself is very ratchet-y. It's like pulling teeth when you first get it then it breaks im slowly.\nOverall, it is a great mouse if you love to customize things, but very daunting and annoying if you don't. I would take the 502X over this one.",
      "Better than Razer. Might go wireless. I like heavy mice.",
      "Great mouse. Lots of buttons but they can't always be mapped to everything in games but I usually only use 1 or 2 anyways.",
      "The holy grail of mice.",
      "Lovely mouse. Nothing much to say about it other than that the reprogrammable buttons are very good and the suite of options you get for them in G HUB is fantastic. I like this mouse, but there might honestly be better options out there.",
      "Have 3 of these, they are great.",
      "meh",
      "Most popular mouse for a reason. Feels great so far.",

      "Looks and feels great but razers annoying software makes it a hassle for no reason",
      "Love this mouse. Even bought a second one in white just because it was so cheap. It often goes on sale between $30-40 so very worth it at that price IMO. It's basically the Basilisk V3 Pro but wired, more or less the same features. Might be a bit heavy for some if you really care about that. Chose this over others because it makes for a great productivity mouse as well. I like that the scroll wheel has side clicks and the hypershift button allows for a lot of macros and alternate keymaps for more functionality.",
      "I love the free-spin mode. Makes scrolling on websites more easier.",
      "My Logitech MK320 Mouse-Key combo finally burnt out on me, and the Razer Basilisk is part of the replacement crew. I never knew I needed an unlocking scroll wheel until this last year and wow, does it ever make a difference going through bighuge documents. I also love the RGB programming options and for every setting I have made my mouse flash obnoxious colors. It's joyous.",
      "Got two of these. Best mouse in terms of productivity / development so far.\nIf you like the \"free wheeling\" scroll wheel, but dislike the bad / quickly degrading switches of the Logitech and similar mouse brands, this is the next best option: no too soft clicks, and even 2 years on, no \"sticky\" click issues either. Also, the surface texture is really solid and not annoying as with some \"gamer performance\" mice.",
      "Best mouse. I really really like razer, and this mouse also has CHROMA. So, that's one of the reasons I bought it also.",
      "It's functional and the RGB looks neat. It actually does glow from underneath, so that was a pleasant surprise to me.",
      "Solid mouse! Pretty ergonomic, and its pretty light for me! I sometimes get confused why people buy superlights just because theyre lighter, but this is light enough for me! The RGB is really nice, and I haven't had an issue with the software (Don't use it anyways).",
      "I started out with a DeathAdder v3 that I purchased from Amazon. About 4 months after standing this PC up, the scroll wheel went bad. I contacted Razer about the issue. I sent them a video of how the mouse was behaving along with a copy of the Amazon receipt. Razer, after giving me a set of initial things to try, informed me that the mouse had been listed as stolen and refused to communicate any further about it. Nobody has even attempted to explain how Amazon sold me a stolen product. However, Amazon DID give me a full refund with which I bought this Basilisk for about 1/3 the price.\nThanks, Razer.",
      "Good high DPI mouse, I really like the rebindable buttons and stuff. If you care about RGB, the software is a bit of a pain to use, I just set it up once and left it."

I went ahead and bought the powerplay mousepad to help keep it charged, as it can die rather fast(fast being a couple of days). I enjoy using it, and it fits my needs and my style rather well. For hand size reference I'm a chef and wear size extra large disposable gloves in the kitchen.",

Gotta mention that you should turn on onboard memory mode in ghub and ditch ghub; do yourself a favor and get onboard memory manager from Logitech to manage the mouse, if you need a software for the mouse. I've personally set the mouse to Optical-only, 2000hz polling rate and only 1600dpi and deleted ghub. Granted I still have onboard memory manager, though I barely use because I only use 1600dpi, so I've got no need to change the dpi.",

I had been using a Pepper Jobs W10 just for basic navigation but using it for stuff other than media gets to be tedious (never mind gaming).\nThis wireless G502 X is great, just as good as the wired model as far as I can tell. I haven't noticed any latency issues. Battery life is solid but only with leds off, which is slightly disappointing. Turning those on greatly reduces battery life regardless of effects or brightness. Logitech's software is a little annoying but required in order to disable leds, though I do like you can right click on the system tray icon to check battery life.",

      "Picked this up the day it released. Used it's father mouse for the longest time and was always my favorite. When they released this new and improved version that was still a g602 at its soul, it was a no brainer.",
      "The mouse feels good, but the software is sluggish in my computer at startup, stopping me from adjusting the dpi for a while.",
      "Nicest mouse I've ever owned. Smooth and responsive, feels good in my hand. I understand the price tag now. I just hope the durability further proves the point.",

      "Really good mouse, it feels so good on your hands. That is if you're right-handed.",
      "Basically a G502 Lightspeed on steroids, it glides a little better and with the introduction of USB C it is finally compatible with more than one cable for charging. The RGB is done pretty well, it can be easily customized using the lighting management of Logitech G Hub (think of it what you want, it has gotten better, I think).\nMy only problem: I managed to slide a few times to the left too far and hit the switch that turns the DPI up when the mouse collided with my keyboard case. That was pretty annoying, especially in a shooter, but it has gotten better once I realized that could happen. Basically don't ram the mouse into something sideways when you don't want to activate the side buttons.",
      "Other than the badly styled lights and no option of a secondary Bluetooth connection. Perfect mouse.",
      "It's a really nice mouse, but holy crap, DO NOT set the DPI over 3200 if you want it to be controllable, lol."

      "Highly reputed and popular. It comes with a type-c connector and havn't experienced any lag. You do need the logitech GHub app to change certain dpi and rgb settings, seems bloatware, but if its your thing you do get that option.",
      "Using it after a good 6+months, the mouse wheel started acting up. Would spam scroll going down and would sometimes input scrolling up.",
      "It is a really good mouse, I like how light it is and it doesn't take a lot of force to click and it is pretty gliddy. However I am taking of 1 star because I can't figure out how to completely turn of the rgb to make the battery life longer. Other than that I would give it five stars if it wasn't for the software.",
      "I love this mouse because of the 4 side buttons and light and last long without charging",
      "Wireless is a game changer. The Logitech G Hub software is great and easy to use, the battery life is good and I also bought a wireless charging station so I just have to place my mouse on it to charge. I also like how light it is. I became an instant pro first game I played with this.",

      "This thing is still a beast even in 2023. I got this for about $80 which is a lot better than the usual $120. Mice are very subjective and preference-based but this thing is perfect for me. The weight is really good, the shape fits perfectly with my hand, the switches are very responsive and light, and the RGB is also nice. Overall, a great mouse for the price, but if only if it's on discount. If it's not, just get the Superlight version"

      "Good but I would go wireless next time.",
      "Nice feel and responsiveness. Good aesthetic. Unfortunately it's kinda buggy with the lighting.",
      "It was good while it lasted, but this mouse broke on me in multiple ways. The dreaded double-clicking issue showed up after 1.5 years. Both side buttons double-click about half the time. The mouse wheel will also register in the opposite direction sometimes. All of this makes web browsing an exercise in frustration, which should be the easiest possible thing for a mouse to do. Pro: I appreciate being able to use the RGB without software running.",

      "Got the 2nd version on the first version FYI. Coming from a viper v3 pro and I love this mouse, it's light and feels good to game with. One thing I'm gonna have to mention is, don't ever use logitech ghub and if your are using it for the superlight then delete it, it's frankly terrible. Set the mouse to onboard memory mode and get onboard memory manager from Logitech instead. OMM lets you manage the onboard memory on the Superlight",
      "The best mouse",
      "Probably one of the best mice out there, not only as a wireless mouse but also with its weight. If you prefer a lightweight mouse and want great performance. This is the mouse for you, especially if you pair it with the lightspeed wireless mousepad that charges the mouse without any cables.",
      "Reason its still one of the best mice even though its 3 years old. 60 grams is a game changer especially compared to my other mouse which was 80g. The only problem was the clicks which I didn't like they felt to mushy and didn't give great feedback. So I bought a couple Kalih GM2.0 mice switches, took the mouse apart and desodered the old ones and put the new ones one, also allowed me to upgrade the skates. Glad Logitech fixed it with the GPX 2 but mad they didn't do at least 4k Hz polling and sub 40g like other premium mice are. Will probably get the new Ultralight X by final mouse when they drop in November.",
      "Lightest gaming mouse I've owned. Fits my hand well. 10/10 would recommend.",
      "Amazing mouse with a very long lasting battery. Basicly almost 50/50 of all CS Pro's use this mouse. Be like them.",
      "God tier mouse, can be had with discounts throughout the year and is very much worth it.",
      "This mouse is not for everyone, but I think almost anyone would be happy with it. I absolutely love this mouse and have had it for almost two years now with zero problems whatsoever. I am very happy with it and will continue to use it for quite literally everything I do."

However, it has helped my wrist fatigue and pain immensely. Battery life @ 1000Hz is excellent and only requires me to charge it once a week or so. However, if you do get the 4K Hyperpolling Module, you'll want to charge it every night.\nThe only downside is Razer Synapse existing - however - you can configure your settings, save them to the onboard profile, and never touch Synapse again.

      "the ratchet scrolling mechanism feels nice and the build quality is overall good. just wish it had linux support",
      "Just an amazing mouse. It's expensive but worth it for the long term productivity user.",
      "I used to not understand the fuss for ergonomic mice, and to a degree I still don't when it comes to stuff like vertical mice... but this is a much more reasonable form factor. Comfortable in the hand, the clicks are soft and quiet without feeling mushy, and the side wheel + gesture/task view button on the bottom are very nice and customisable.\nI only have two issues: 1) I get it has a 125Hz polling rate to extend the battery life, I'm not expecting 1000Hz like a gaming mouse, but... 125Hz definitely isn't smooth enough even for just light work/study usage. ~500Hz would be a good middle ground, I think. 2) Sometimes, when my CPU utilisation gets high, the mouse movement kinda... stutters?",
      "SUPER QUIET CLICKS. Super satisfying! Haha. Highly recommend"

      "best mouse for mmo's (especially warcraft)",
      "It is a really nice mouse for any things gaming, and the cord is long enough, it can reach a PC positioned pretty far away. I got this as a gift also, though, and can't speak on the price to performance ratio.",
      "Overall I like it. The side buttons are GOATed, and it's easily the best mouse on the market if you want a large number of buttons on the side. However, my one problem with it is whenever I plugged it in it would constantly spam a number like it was typing. This persisted even after installing the drivers for it. Turns out one of the buttons on the side was stuck, and after unstucking the button the problem went away. Still kind of annoying to deal with though.",
      "big fan of mmo mouses, this one is a nice step up from my old razer naga's",
      "So easy to use, and makes playing any games easier.",
      "Came from a Razer Naga to this, I miss the two buttons to the left of the left mouse button, but other than that it serves my needs great. Mostly play MMORPGs and the number pad is excellent for the large number of action buttons needed."

      "Perfect mouse other than the fact you can't use it USB mode when it runs out of battery. I had to return a corsair dark star or whatever because it was too clunky, this one is light and looks insanely good. RGB is a nice touch too. Got used-like new on Amazon for a big discount and would NOT get it over $80.",
      "Let me preface this review by saying I would NOT buy this mouse at full price, which is roughly ~$150 at the current moment (got this half off during a Black Friday sale). That being said, I've owned a lot of gaming mice and this one seems to have a solid build quality; the charging dock it comes with is also a nice premium that I've not had with others. I've only lightly used this product for about a week's time so I can't talk about its durability, but I'll say it has one of the better-looking designs as far as a gaming mouse goes. If I can remember, I'll come back here and update this review in the near future...\nEDIT: Used this mouse for about 3 months now. It's been great, but a minor nitpick I have is that there have been a couple of small instances where the connection dropped out for a few seconds while in use, then would go back to normal afterwards. It actually hasn't happened in awhile nor is it often, so I'm not majorly concerned—it comes off as a typical hiccup.\nGonna Copypaste some notes from a reply on the build this mouse was used in below:\nA note is that if you prefer to Shut Down instead of putting your PC to Sleep, you may have to play around with your USB settings to get the Charging Dock to stay on while your PC is off (just go to your Mouse in the 'Hardware & Devices' section of the Control Panel and check \"allow this device to wake up the computer\"). You can tell what Charge level the mouse has when it's docked as the Razer logo RGB shows a certain color:\nSolid Green = Fully charged\nStrobe Green = Mostly charged\nStrobe Yellow = Medium battery\nStrobe Red = Low battery\nThe battery life is not bad for a chargeable mouse, around 16~20hrs (don't quote me bc I don't always use it when it's not charging). I'm pretty decent with keeping it charged so I've only had this happen once, but if the mouse ever starts to die on you it'll blink Red while in use. Of course I didn't realize until I took my hand off of it lol",
      "Super light, great software, and looks stunning.",
      "Great so far, the charging dock is a huge bonus.",
      "One of the few high-end wireless mice that are actually ambidextrous, great as a lefty.",
      "Great mouse so far. Coming from a G703 it only took me a short while to adjust to. The charging dock is really handy.",
      "As long as you dont mind the lack of extra buttons and having to charge it every once in a while, it's fantastic and absolutely worth the money",
      "Pretty good battery life, have to charge it on dock every 2 - 3 weeks, rgb is nice but not too much, the razer software is kinda bad. I haven't had any issues so far.",
      "Not main mouse but feels pretty good! (Mine is \"Pink\" not \"Black\")\nPositives:\nLight Weight\nGood grip\nHigh dpi\nNegatives:\nCan't get rid of the base station charging lighting! (Can't change it from green, yellow, orange, red)\nAccidentally press the extra buttons many times",
      "Great mouse. The dock is really cool. Razer has dogsh*t software though and it really annoys me how much it pops up, but other than that good mouse."

      "I would recommend this mouse for someone who is on a tight budget. It is a solid mouse with 2 adjustable dpi button so you can turn up and down the dpi on the fly. It is pretty responsive, decently glidy, and has multiple color options. My only complaints about it would be that the wire is a little stiff (however it is braided so thats a plus), and after about 2 years of use the scroll wheel does make a tiny squealing sound. Other than that it is an amazing mouse and has held up pretty well over 3 years.",
      "It literally died in like 3 weeks or something lmao, they sent me a new one immediately after I brought it up no questions asked. And they told me to just throw away the dead one. No way, I'm gonna fix it someday.",
      "Comfortable to hold, nice weight to it, very good tracking and lighting. None of the macro buttons feel squishy and cheap. The software is a bit confusing to use at first but it works.",
      "Works well, cheap so if i break, its not a big deal.",
      "This mouse is fantastic. The buttons make it easy to adjust the sensitivity. It looks nice and is well-constructed. Braided cable. Good ergonomics. I'd say it slightly favors a palm grip over a claw grip but either will work.\nMy only complaint so far is that you can't change the RGB static color without software. Luckily it works with OpenRGB on Linux so I was ok. The scroll wheel is a little slow.",
      "Worked great, especially for the price. Rgb works well, and feels great",
      "Good mouse overall, I don't really like the material on the side.",
      "As far as a mouse goes, this thing is perfect. It has multiple DPI options, and in the software, it even has sliders for you to increase the maximum DPI past it's factory settings. If you're simply looking for a cheap mouse with a great feel, this is the one to go for, without my later gripes, this mouse would be a 5/5.\nAs far as RGB concerns. it looks great, the LEDS are almost perfectly diffused. However, RGB software is the reason why I'd be rated this mouse as a 4/5 rather than a 5. I'm not sure whether or not it's just my mouse or if this a problem that other users have come across, but whenever I try to change the mouse color to anything other than the 5 preset colors that are given as options, I get a really weird whitish color. Even when the cursor is on a vibrant red or blue, the mouse will show an ugly almost off-white color. I'd suggest to either stick with the preset rainbow or color shift options. Then again, this mouse is VERY cheap money wise so I can't complain too much I suppose.",
      "Great deal for a cheap mouse and matches my keyboard. It is not as small as I thought it would be which is nice because it fits my hand perfectly. It is smooth and comfortable. has lots of good RGB options that you control with the buttons behind the mouse wheel. It has some grippiness on the sides and 2 extra thumb buttons. I am not sure yet if you can or want to use the buttons behind the wheel for keybindings in games without changing the colors or if they even give to option to have that function but I am ok with just the 2 thumb buttons if I need them.",
      "Great quality for the money. If you have big hand like me it might not be super duper comfortable but all things considered this is a great mouse."

      "I have large hands and use kind of a claw grip when I game - this mouse fits perfectly.",
      "I thought it was time to replace my old Logitech G604, which was becoming a bit threadbare from my constant use. I went to a Microcenter to see which mouse fit my hand best, as I've bought several mice over the years and relegated them to the drawer after they didn't feel \"right\". I ended up with the Dark Core because, as a claw grip gamer, my pinky is over smushed on the side or dragging on the mouse pad, and I loved the pinky rest adapter on the outside of this mouse.\nThe ergonomics are good, however the mouse regularly loses connectivity, creating a laggy/skipping effect on the mouse cursor. I've never experienced such a thing in years of using my Logitech G604. In addition to this, iCUE is an exceptionally finicky software. It doesn't play nicely with other RGB driver software, often requiring me to disable others to adequately save hardware settings, and the user interface for rebinds is absolutely dreadful; unintuitive and very difficult to use.\nSometimes you shouldn't try to fix what isn't broken. Very disappointed in Corsair lately.",
      "good gaming mouse",
      "I like it more than my Logitech G502, which is a fantastic mouse. I bought this because it has the finger wing part on both sides, so my pinky doesnt slide on the mousepad. It feels good in my hand."

Im used to arching my clicking fingers and using a wrist finger combo to move the mouse, this makes me palm the device, and really get intimate with it to reach all the functionality they put into the mouse.",
      "Quite a bit lighter than the original G502 and the skates are much better. It moves much more fluidly for precise movements in games as opposed the the kinda jittery movement I got with precise movements with the original G502."

      "Still using this mouse and it is a spectacular value for the money.",
      "Great mouse. Lasting forever.",
      "Great mouse. Got this after my MX518 stopped working and haven't looked back since.",
      "Got this given this for free so no complaints.",
      "Good mouse, on the smaller side of things. Comes with customizable weights and lots of buttons.",
      "Its starting to have a few flaws with infinite scroll wheel, but its fixed itself. Still my favorite mouse, better than the OEM Dell mouse from 2006. If something happens to it, I'll get another. 2016 and still going. I have replaced the pads once in 2021.",
      "Best mouse I have ever used in my life. It's pretty old now so I don't expect it to last much longer. Once it breaks, I'm getting a G502 Lightspeed. My life has been changed by Logitech.",
      "Main mouse. Very versatile and agile. Love it for gaming.",
      "This is an excellent and affordable mouse with versatile functionality for a workstation, gaming rig, or both! The design is sleek, modern, stylish, and adaptable to all hand sizes. The LMB and RMB are extended for long fingers or palm gripping, and hotkey buttons are accessible and closely spaced, but don't get in the way during usage. The scroll-wheel can be toggled between free-spinning infinite scroll, and \"click-scrolling.\" The thumb rest shelf has easy access to the three side hotkeys. The weight is adjustable with included insertable metal plates. The design does include a lot of crevices, so it can be a challenge to keep it clean of crumbs, pet hair, and whatever else; however a recessed laser sensor ensures continuous accuracy of input readings.\nLogitech Gaming software allows custom programming of the six mouse hotkey buttons and even the middle mouse button. Three distinct profiles are saved internally on the mouse itself, so you can keep your settings even if you switch between rigs. Each profile can be set to different hotkeys, macros, RGB coloration, and DPI sensitivity. Beyond the six hotkeys (*recommended reserving one for quick profile switching,) the \"G-Shift\" function allows a second set of programmable commands available while simultaneously holding down the user-programmed G-Shift hotkey. Profiles have up to five DPI settings each that can be quick-shifted or toggled between with a hotkey.\nDurability and build quality are both high, and the cord is braided with a cloth wrap. It is unlikely any part will break within the mouse's lifetime.\nThere is nothing I can't recommend about this mouse, other than keeping the surface clean. It is a great customizable mouse for anybody- students, office drones, gamers, and even the most casual users will benefit from the Logitech G502, and the base model is affordable! You don't have to be a competitive gamer or professional streamer to justify purchasing this mouse.",
      "Great mouse, I've had it for 1.5 years and it's still working perfectly. Although the software can be quite infuriating at times, Logitech is swift to fix issues and I've had way fewer problems in the past 8-ish months."

I have tried Logitech mice, SteelSeries, and it just wasn't working for me, this form factor is by far my favourite. But be warned, razer products to not last, so be ready for potential headaches if you buy this.",

      "Very great mouse, I've also had this one since around 2019-2020 and I got it at the same time as I got the keyboard.",
      "This is my second Nightsword mouse and I love it. I am 6'-3\" with larger than average hands and this mouse fits me well with no wrist/hand pain. There are customizable components and it lights up.",
      "Best mouse. Excellent feel. Aesthically pleasing, high quality build with a pristine wheel scroller and clicker.\nPerhaps slightly Overpriced. Wait for it to go on sale at $80 cad.\nI like that the 2 buttons below the wheel cycle through all the Icue profiles you have save in one folder. If you save all your profiles in one folder, these buttons will navigate through all of them, while never having to open Icue past the mini icon stage. Not even when it's minimized, I'm talking about when Icue is in it least obtrusive and hardware demanding state, while still functioning.\nAs indicated when it's only the mini icon on the far right of the screen in Windows 10 that is visible anywhere.\nthat's a pretty cool feature of this mouse and a welcome surprise.\nThe thumb trigger button, the big one on the side, is slightly tricky to reach for average and small sized hands with anything less than an ever so slightly tilted to the left, a palm grip.\nA claw grip with an average to small sized hand will not be able to naturally reach that button without shifting ones hand over a tiny bit.",
      "Still not my “perfect” mouse, but as close as I can get. The two buttons to the side of your index finger are flimsy and hard to differentiate when you aren’t looking at them. So I would have made those one button. I also would have moved the the hard to reach thumb button in more, easier to click, and split it into two. I also like non-plasticky mice, so ai would have liked a more premium feel in materials.",
      "Upgraded from Red Dragon and I'm glad I did. iCue lighting controls a plus.",

Some might find it a little large and/or heavy.\nI’m on my second G703 as the one I originally purchased began double clicking. Logitech sent me a new one with very little hassle. The customer service experience was nearly painless and shipping was quick.\nEDIT: Began to experience the exact same issue (double clicking left mouse button) with the warrantied unit as well. I can no longer recommend this mouse (-3 stars). It's great when it works...",

      "Great mouse, bad RGB control software. You are forced to install Logitech's bloatware/spyware/control software to change the LED color or else you are stuck with a constant rainbow animation on the scroll wheel and the \"G\" logo. I set the DPI change button to adjust the RGB brightness so at least I can turn it off.",
      "Low latency wireless, ergonomic and fairly light. Love it.",
      "Does what a mouse should do without fuss. Like the prominent \"G\" RGB. Felt a bit light without the weight, but once added, gave it a nice heft on the mousepad. No problems with wireless. Because of browsing, it doesn't sleep much so its battery drains a couple of days faster than the keyboard, but that is to be expected. Still haven't programmed side/top buttons for gaming yet. Will update once I do."

      "This mouse is amazing, I bought this mouse to replace my old 2 year old Razer Mamba Elite, great mouse btw, and I got a say that when some reviewers said that this mouse improved their gaming performance, they weren't lying. I found my self hit no scopes left and right like nobody's business about a day after having and adjusting to the mouse. And after I got comfortable with the feel, I started Absolut beaming players to the point I'd say it looked like Aimbot, but that's just me. I'm don't fully agree with the $150 price tag but if you can it on sale I highly recommend it because the technology Razer put in this thing is next level.",
      "The very fact that this mouse exists blows my mind. It weighs 2/3 of what my Basilisk v2 does while being wireless, without sacrificing on battery life, charging speed, or comfort. I disliked the Viper Ultimate as I found my pinky would trigger the right side buttons, but as the v2 Pro only has buttons for right handed users I find it much more comfortable; shape-wise I'd say the viper is one of the most universal mice out there (and doesn't have holes, which is incredible at sub 60 g). Surprisingly, it's big enough for my 20x11cm hand to fingertip grip comfortably with a little bit of carpal stabilization. The included grip tape feels very high quality. Razer's software is a resource hog and kind of terrible, but Hypershift is seriously cool and one of the things I liked a lot about my Basilisk as well. Haven't got 4 KHz polling up and running yet, but apparently that's a thing too.\nI bought this as a secondary mouse, but I'm so impressed with it I'm actually going to try dailying it. Razer is onto a winner with this one, I'd go so far as to call it the single highest performance gaming mouse currently on the market.\nEDIT: It broke :( Not going to knock off a star but the scroll wheel went after I used middle click as my hypershift modifier for 8 months. RMA was mostly smooth apart from the refund taking forever to process, but we'll see if it breaks again later. Don't do what I did, folks; the middle click isn't really meant for that.",

      "Cool mouse. I primarily game with Controller, but RGB looks cool.",
      "It's a great mouse. Very responsive, and the RGB is easy to control, even though there is basically no RGB. The 2.4ghz has really low latency, and overall it's a solid mouse. I do have problems with it though. It is a bit small and it makes my hand cramp up after a while, and not all my fingers can rest on it, which is a bit uncomfortable. It has horrible battery life, I've been using it for only 2 months and I've already had to replace the batteries 3 times. I tried power efficient mode, which works but it turns the mouse off after a minute or so and it is really annoying to wake back up. It's a good mouse, but I would either want a more efficient one or the wired version.",
      "Overall a good budget-friendly wireless mouse. Glides well on my mousepad. Only complaint would be the battery life. The mouse promises 400hr+, which is true, but you have to run it on high efficiency mode which disables the rgb (not a problem), and decreases the polling rate to 125hz (slightly more of a problem). The 125hz polling rate is very noticeable in games, movement looks very jagged. For general productivity its ok, scrolling accuracy seems to be decreased a lot, not all scrolls are registered. So I just created two profiles within the steelseries software, one for general use, and one specifically for gaming with the full 1000hz polling rate. At first I used the mouse on full polling rate, and within a week the batteries died, never again will I do that.",
      "Cheap, lightweight, has nice lighting effects. Does the job well, I don’t really have the need for many hotkeys and only stick with one DPI setting (you can have different profiles on this though).",

      "Good for mmos, also good for a ton of other non mmo games. Old reliable.",
      "(NEW, DISCOUNTED) I find this mouse to be the most comfortable I've used, even more so than my MX Master 2S. I use this to play FFXIV and it works like a charm, and is simply amazing. I was considering purchasing the Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite as I enjoyed the texture and length of that mouse, however, the Logitech G600 is more useful because of the \"G-SHIFT\" button, which effectively doubles the amount of available keys to be used. My few complaints are: 1. That there is no longer a white version in circulation anymore. 2. The new Logitech G Hub software does not permit the user to rebind the G7 and G8 keys, in which the old Logitech Gaming Software app must be installed and mapped this way. As far as I know this software is Windows and Mac exclusive. I’m sure there’s something floating around the AUR though. 3. This mouse is slightly too short for my hand, if only it were only a couple of millimeters longer. 4. The numberpad keys can be somewhat wobbly, however, this is not too severe.",
      "Best mouse if you need a lot of utility buttons, and feels great in the hand.",
      "I'm giving this a 4 star on basis of original version. This was real good when it came out of the box for my needs and I've been easily able to adapt the side buttons in some games. Obviously if you don't do MMOs in the more traditional sense or you aren't playing complex games where it would require more keyboard control than your hand would normally allow, it would be better to look at another mouse with less buttons. But if you are one that has either programs where having simple reach with easily felt differentiated buttons on the thumb and your hand is decently sized, I think this will be for you.\nThe only down side is that the switches don't last if you do any other competitive games. I've had to replace the original switches after the left click started going. Then one day with the replacement of the same switch type with different material, the right click went REALLY hard on it. It was forever stuck on right click. Had to temporarily solder an old mouse's switch into that position and work with it. I got some Kailh switches and these have been working even better than the original switches. If they were in the mouse originally, I'd call it a 5 star.\nSide note, I'm also basing this with the LGS Software as at the time, I had a G15 Keyboard which was only supported by the LGS software. I can't comment on GHub however.",
      "It's comfortable and I haven't found myself accidentally clicking any of the macro buttons yet. Some people could probably do with a little more lighting on it, but I'm not really one for that kind of flashiness, and everything is easy enough to control from the Logi G-Hub program.",
      "Love this Mouse. I'm still getting use to the third button but I changed it to Alt so works great.",
      "Been using these for years. In my experience after about 3 years the left click switch starts double-clicking. I'm on my second G600 and it's starting to double-click now. I'll be buying my third soon. They're cheap enough that I can't knock them down too many stars for the failure rate--the side buttons are fantastic and it's a very ergonomic shape."

      "Every so often this mouse goes for $15. For that price it makes cheap gaming brands like red dragon look like over priced trash. As someone who is 6'5 the mouse is a little small for my palm grip style but its enough that I can be comfortable with it. It has two buttons on the side with a button near the scroll wheel to change DPI. The lighting is VERY bright. The only real \"complaint\" is the scroll wheel. Its very tactile, meaning it is bumpy and creates friction. Besides that 10/10 mouse especially for the price if you can catch it at the right time."

      "I wanted a mouse that didn't have rubber grips or a bunch of unnecessary aesthetic grooves as those get nasty over time. This mouse looks clean, has nice RGB, and feels good in my hand. I bought it more for the look and feel than all the extra buttons, but I have been finding them quite useful now that I've started using them. My favorite thing I've done with one of the buttons is assign one of them the shortcut for enabling/disabling HDR so I don't have to press 3 separate keys every time I want to switch it on/off. Another great feature is the cord; instead of an inflexible rubber cord, this mouse's cord is a very flexible mesh which doesn't get stuck on the edge of my desk or get stuck being bunched up.\nOut of all the devices within my setup, my SteelSeries mouse and keyboard have the best accompanying software (SteelSeries GG). Sure, there is a lot of bloated garbage I am never, ever going to use (like 3D aim trainer), but all manufacturer specific programs have some nonsense in them, and SteelSeries GG doesn't turn all of the nonsense features on like some other programs.\nThe RGB and button-assigning portion of the software (Engine tab) is highly customizable and allows for syncing between different SteelSeries devices. The RGB offers better customization than any of the other RGB software I have to use, and makes me wish that SteelSeries GG was compatible with non-SteelSeries devices. My favorite feature is that it allows you to customize specific colors for effects that use multiple colors. Most of my devices will allow an unchangeable rainbow effect for multi-colored modes, but SteelSeries GG will let me set my own spectrum of colors to shift through. My only option for customizable multi-color on other RGB devices is to manually set different static colors for individual LEDs. Also, unlike some of my other RGB devices, the mouse retains its settings when the computer is restarted or awakes from sleep mode. For example, my AIO uses NZXT CAM for its RGB, and it is completely hit or miss whether the RGB decides to turn on when I start up. My SteelSeries mouse is ready with the last loaded lighting profile as soon as my PC comes on.\nOverall very happy with this mouse.",
      "Solid mouse",
      "Has 4 side buttons, steelseries engine software is great and easy to use. Nothing special, but does the job for me.",
      "Decent mouse, but within a year of purchasing, encountered a hardware issue with the scroll wheel that made scrolling essentially impossible.",
      "Good mouse. The left click took me a couple days to get used to. I cannot review yet how long this will last as I have only had this for a couple weeks at the time of this review! You can customize a lot of the settings to fit you in the Steelseries software.",
      "Ergonomy is great for my hands, and these additional buttons really come in handy. That three-stage button is a pure big brain, for me it's definitely useful.",
      "Comfortable for the most part. Lots of customization with the DPI and RGB settings. Wish it was adjustable in weight (I love heavy mice) and wish it had a thumb rest, kind of miss that on my old G700S."

I like the touch and feel of the mouse overall and the magnetic back to hide the battery and where you can store the dongle (it took me a long time to find it lol). The mouse feels very solid and I like the fact that I can change its speed with the button in the middle by using the Razer software. 10/10 would recommend to someone looking for a great high end mouse.",

      "This might be the best mouse I’ve ever owned. Great color, cool lighting effects, and it’s especially amazing when paired with the docking station.\nYears ago, I had the first version of the Razer Mamba, and it came with a dock that looked like a podium. Back then, charging was done through contact pins, so you had to place the mouse correctly — not difficult, but still required a bit of care. It also had the option to work either wirelessly through the dock or with a special-shaped cable that plugged directly into the mouse.\nNow, things are so much better. The docking station magnetically snaps the mouse into place, just like Apple’s MagSafe. 😄 The dongle is hidden under the bottom cover of the mouse, so you can take it with you, plug it into any device, and keep using the mouse wirelessly — no need to carry the dock around. There’s also Bluetooth support, and any USB-C cable works fine for charging (unless it’s too bulky to fit).\nThe only weird thing is the protruding side button. It’s not recognized as a separate button — you can only assign it to mimic a keypress or macro (or anything available in the Razer app). But this makes it impossible to use properly in games.\nBy “properly” I mean having it recognized as something like Mouse6, instead of being treated as some random key you’ve assigned to it, leaving you wondering why it feels so inconvenient. 😬"

      "It clicks in the moment when your brain just relaises there is an enemy. Very fast, feels good in your hands and I know I will have it until the last atom wears out.",
      "great mice, so many options, great software, can combine with other hw, games setings, for that price, steal",
      "its a mouse. kinda expensive ig maybe i shouldve gotten a logitech. anyway i like the side buttons and the length feels nice",
      "Nothing to write home about really but it's not super lightweight and feels nice in the hand but there are better alternatives out there.",
      "Honestly, at MSRP this mouse isn't worth it, try to find it used for cheap or on sale if you can."

      "I used to use a Red Dragon Mouse and Keyboard Combo that I bought off Amazon and I can honestly say that you can feel the quality differences big time. I decided with the new upgrade of my gaming PC that I would spoil myself with some quality parts to include the mouse and keyboard. I casually game with AAA titles so I look for comfort and simplicity with my computer gaming needs. For my mouse I decided on this one as it matches with my Corsair K70 Keyboard. I personally never used a wireless mouse or keyboard so I just stuck with wired option as I do not mind having a direct connection.\nPROS: The first thing I noticed is that this mouse has a total of 5 buttons which fit very comfortably with my right hand. The mouse itself is very light and does not have the beaming red optical light that some mice do. It does also include a RGB for the Corsair icon which is a nice touch. So far I have tested it quick action FPS such as Overwatch, Counter-Strike and Doom Eternal. I can say that this mouse is very sleek, light and comfortable for gaming.\nCONS: None so far.\nOverall I am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend for anyone looking for a simple gaming mouse for their needs.",
      "A good mouse that works well and is easy-to-use.",
      "I got this mouse for $25 on Black Friday as a part of a keyboard + mouse combo deal. You definitely pay for what you get in terms of build quality at that price but an RGB mouse for only $25 is a steal. Personally I would pay an extra bit of money and get something like a Razer Deathadder V2 but it's really down to personal preference when it comes to peripherals so this does the job for now.",
      "There is no reason to spend more than $25 on a mouse. This shows it. High-quality switches, 6 buttons, and an RGB light that runs with Corsair's ICue software.",
      "The finish on this feels great for pretty much any grip, the programmable buttons on the side are very useful in hotkey-intensive games. DPI switch is flexible and easy to use. Great mouse.",
      "Love the shape, love the feel. I use a fingertip/claw grip and I have large hands.",
      "This mouse is among of the best ive ever used.",
      "It points, it clicks, AND it lights up!",
      "Great mouse, DPI settings were exciting.",

      "Very impressed with this mouse for being wireless. The included software really helps with productivity.",
      "This mouse feels incredible. It fits my hand really well and I can use it for a long time without feeling strained. The unlockable scroll wheel is a nice touch too, although as a neurodivergent person, I really only use it as a fidget toy :D The thumb rest is very big and made of some very nice rubbery material. It makes for a great user experience since my hand never touches my mouse pad. Very nice! Three minor pain points:\nYou can't use this mouse in wired mode because it only charges over USB-C\nThe thumb rest attracts finger gunk and can become discolored - don't use this mouse with cheeto dust on your fingers!\nMine stopped working randomly - this is kind of a common issue with this mouse because Logitech's QA tends to ignore slightly loose contacts with the internal battery - at least that's what Reddit told me. Send it back to Logitech to get it fixed for free.",

      "Have been using this since 2016, will be replacing with a Basilisk V3 Pro or a G502, still works like new with very little wear and tear. Only downside was the software, it's honestly terrible but recently seems to have improved, no longer crashes and finally recognizes games automatically now.",
      "I have large hands and this fits my hand shape nearly perfectly. The extra buttons are a bit gimmicky but Logitech software makes it easy to disable them or reconfigure.",
      "Great wired mouse for not too much money. Loads of buttons for me - the back and forward especially makes web browsing easy. the left and right click plus the wheel which has a click function. Also it has 3 buttons to adjust the DPI - two work as up and down DPI selection and the last button sets to 400DPI which is good for FPS games when you need to accurately aim at the target.",
      "Perfect mouse for palm grip and if you have large hands.",
      "I love this mouse, got it for discount at Christmas and it is honestly amazing, I only wish you could change the LED color but no stars off because of the great performance",
      "I got it for £18 during Black Friday 2020. It has got \"only\" 4000 DPI, but what many people do not realise is the fact that IRL you do not use more than 500-2000 (unless you're doing anything other than gaming).\nIt tracks superbly, I have been using it at mainly 1000-2000DPI and has not missed a \"dot per inch\".",
      "Got all the DPI settings in the palm and is light-weight (vs G502). Can't ask for much after going with the Hyperion Fury.",
      "Now, this is a proper gaming mouse. Not the best one in the market but right up there with them. Doesn't have a ton of features, but more than you'll need. The only upgrade over this will be a massive overkill G502. Anyway, back to my piece. The Logitech logo with the LED can only be set to a hue of blue and can be given a breathing effect. There's a DPI indicator LED as well. Comes with 8 programmable buttons, which is more than I ever need. Lightweight, smooth movement. This mouse is massive, might not fit into your hand if you have small ones. All in all, money well spent. Absolutely loving it.",
      "Got this on sell for 31$ it was nearly half price of g502 hero and I'm really happy about it, great mouse.",
      "The reason why I specifically bought this was the DPI buttons being on the side of the mouse instead of the top. I always hit them when on the top. This mouse has a great grip. It fits right in your palm. I've been using this for a while and it is showing no signs of wear."

It's also not a deal breaker by any means, as those side buttons are still comfortable to press while gaming, just not quite as comfortable as something like a Logitech G502."

Just resting my fingers on them will cause them to click.\nI'll likely be buying a new mouse here soon, but it is a nice mouse for about $50.",
      "I can't even describe how many I tried. Razer, Rapoo, Logitech, HyperX etc. Had at least a dozen. This one exceeds everything. It's perfect in every aspect. Sure, the RGB isn't the easiest to configure, but I seriously can't explain how good this mouse is. It's perfect.",
      "light mouse :)",
      "Great mouse for the price. Good build quality, great skates, great tracking, great switches, great feel, great scroll wheel (some people might not like it), super light cord, practically weightless, big for larger hands, decent software, and amazing price.",
      "Comfy, and glides well. Also has great RGB.",
      "(NEW, GIFT) This mouse has the least problematic software of all the mice I use with this build, and that is because of how meek and basic the software is. Besides the software, this mouse feels amazing in first-person games and action-oriented games, as it is slim, breathable, responsive, and glides like an angel. It is a rather minimal mouse for the price, however this is usually what type of mouse most people are interested in, and in that category, it is one of the highest of it's class.",
      "Practically weightless. This is so much lighter than my corsair iron claw and I love it.",
      "Really good mice. The only potentially bad thing is that the honeycomb shape on the top might accumulate some skin residue if that's a problem for you.",
      "Not to mention the hilarious branding, but the Glorious Model D feels so good in the hand, so lightweight, and with quality pads it comes with, it simply glides along your mousepad, and feels like air - it feels so good, and is more ergonomic than my old Razer Deathadder Chroma. Not to mention the customizable RGB with the side lights - this mouse has style. The complimentary stickers were also a nice bonus. Glorious - we NEED a MMORPG/MOBA version of the Model D! That would be heaven.",
      "Looks fantastic, build quality is solid and light. The software that is used to change DPI, macros, lighting effects etc is very easy to use and works great. The buttons are fairly light compared to the old Dell mice I'm used to and it slides beautifully. Once I've been using it for a while and gotten better used to it I will probably update this review and change it to 5 stars (as it feels amazing so far)."

      "Been using this as my daily driver for years - would be really hard to go back to any other model at this point. I do the feel the rubber isn't the best element to weather years of abuse and doesn't age as well as metal, but it's a small price to pay for the ergonomics. I had a terrible experience with its Bluetooth connection, borderline unusable because of the lag/choppiness. Fortunately the Bolt receiver is far more reliable and I have not experienced any trouble with it.",
      "Used the first gen model for many years and was more than satisfied with it. So far the current gen Master continues that trend",
      "Great productivity mouse, feels just right in the hand and love it for my work use cases.",
      "Amazing Bluetooth + wireless receiver mouse for creative work. Mappable buttons per program with magnetic scroll wheel that operates in 2 modes. Free scroll and line-by-line precision scrolling. Easily switch across 3 devices linked via Bluetooth pair or wherever the wireless receiver is plugged in. USB C charging for quick recharge and lasts for days",
      "Probably not for gamers, and maybe not for people with smaller hands, but I love this thing. The weighted magnetic scroll wheel makes scrolling a breeze, the side scroller makes spreadsheets just a little more fun, and the back and forward thumb buttons are great for browsing (and probably other things, but I haven't gotten used to all the other uses yet).\nOne downside is that while the device is compatible with Linux, the software that comes with it is not. This means Linux button customization is difficult/limited. Still 5 stars though.",
      "Lost connection via wireless a few times and the logitech software lost its settings a few times too but otherwise excellent.",
      "best productivity mouse imo. love it so much, i bought another, one at home, one in office. works seamlessly between mac & windows",
      "Hands down the best mouse you can get for MacOS functionality (or in general). Extremely ergonomic, beefy battery life, full charges in under 15-20 min via USB-C, endless customization options per Application (requires Logitech Options or Options Plus, both free software).",
      "For creativity/productivity/office use, this is a good mouse. Plenty of customizability and functionality for any user. It is fairly comfortable, but the Razer Pro Click is a step ahead of the MX Master 3 for comfort due to a better shape and far lower weight. All connectivity options are equally viable but I believe the 2.4GHz receiver to be the superior method. Battery life is excellent and I almost never need to worry about getting too low. If I had to choose between the MX Master 3 or the Razer Pro Click, I would rather use the Razer Pro Click.\nvery high weight (~141g)\nlong battery life\ngood connectivity options (with USB-C connector!)\ninfinite scroll wheel\nno exact DPI adjustment (\"Pointer Speed\" slider is all you get)\nvery low polling rate (125 Hz)\nfairly loud clicks with questionable switch reliability",
      "Both fully supported on Linux using Solaar and using a single Logitech Unifying receiver (single USB-A Port taken)."

      "Ehhh it's a good mouse I've had it for a couple of years now.",
      "A little pricey for what it is, but then again, you do get the advantage of wirelessness. Good if you want a mouse that's simple but still quality. Maybe a nitpick, but the RGB can seem a little flickery sometimes in how it transitions between colors; it's not as smooth as my Corsair keyboard. Doesn't matter a lot of the time, though, since your hand will cover it.",
      "It feels great in my hand and has a nice tight response. I got mine on sale though.",
      "I’ve had this mouse for almost two years, this is the mouse I’ve had before I built this PC. Still works great and the battery on it is fantastic.\nIf you like simple mice like I do, the Corsair harpoon RGB is a great choice.",
      "I've used this mouse for a but now and it's a great value mouse. It's wireless and has RGB - that's all I wanted. The battery life is plenty for me and the sensor is good enough. It doesn't fit my hand perfectly but it was a good value so I got it.",
      "Very satisfied. Can be used wired (special micro-USB cable) or wireless (with special dongle or Bluetooth). You can put the dongle inside the mouse if you need to move with it for some reason. Even though I personally only use it wired, I would advise you to take this one instead of the other versions. Having the choice between wired and wireless is very convenient and totally worth the price difference (even though I paid mine less than the normal version somehow). I have also noticed that, unlike this one, the wire on the wired version isn't centered. Pretty sure it must be annoying. You can create different profiles (with iCUE) and switch on the fly between them. More buttons than I personally need, but might not be enough for some people. I find it very comfortable (I'd say I have neither small nor big hands), but I can understand some people don't (mostly depending on their hand position). The best, as usual, would be to try it before buying. Pretty sure it's not good for lefties though.",
      "It's a mouse, and it does mouse stuff well. It's Corsair's basic RGB gaming mouse, with the Corsair logo lighting up, and a DPI switch with a back/forward button on the left side of the mouse. It's all I need in a mouse, I do wish the battery lasted a bit longer but I knew it wouldn't be as good as my non-gaming wireless mouse in the battery department - a given.\nAfter a few years it seems to have gotten a bit choppy movement-wise. I've got a Razer Basilisk V3 Pro now with this bad larry as a backup. Still, it is a solid entry level gaming mouse.",
      "Great mouse, however the wireless USB adaptor stopped working for me unfortunately so I am using it as a wired mouse",
      "Got it for $20 a while back and I'm very impressed that it is still in basically perfect condition although a little dirty. It's fast, looks good, cheap, good battery life, and will make me never use wired mice again.",
      "Bit of a latency issue when plugged in, only fix is to either reconnect it or unplug and use wireless mode. Otherwise a good mouse for everyday use, even wirelessly."

      "Logitech and discontinuing great products, name a more iconic duo. I wish I bought like 10 of these back when they were 60 bucks each. I'm gonna be real sad when I can't use this mouse anymore. 6 tactile side buttons in a rectangle, on-board memory, unlockable scroll wheel, big and heavy. Literally a perfect mouse. The only thing out there that's similar is the Naga Pro 2 but that thing's $150 minimum.\nBit of advice to anyone with a wireless Logitech mouse: If you can get away with it, get Ghub off your computer. I don't know why but this mouse's battery life literally tripled or more when I saved my mouse buttons in Ghub to the on-board memory and uninstalled Ghub.",
      "Great wireless mouse, with Logitech's amazing lightspeed wireless connection. I adore all the buttons on the mouse, actually helps a lot both in productivity and gaming. The only thing I DESPISE about this mouse is Logitech's terrible G-Hub software, its atrocious and hard to use.",
      "Over 1000 hours of gaming use, I love this mouse and love its design, completely reprogrammable. Any other mouse feels weird to use because I'm so used to it, it's nice that it uses an AA battery because it lasts so long I've only changed it 3 times, the dpi settings on the mouse are also nice for precision. I wish this mouse would never wear out or break. I've had this mouse for a little over 3 years now btw, I'm gonna be heart broken when it dies of old age and lots of use.",
      "A bang for the buck mouse for MMO, simulator, and complicated games.\nThe downside is the poor durability of the switches.",
      "I have used the G503 for a lot of years on my old computer so I got the newer version for the new computer. Works the same and has the 6 thumb buttons.",
      "Meh. All I want is a simple mouse that offers a click button for hyper scroll. I don't need all the extra side buttons and fancy junk. So this was the compromise to use the reliable \"Lightspeed\" connection and have hyper scroll.\nOverall though, I think Logitech has lost a lot of their footing and every single newer product I have purchased from them has been total junk. It's been 0 for 4 products so I gave up. Actually kind of shocked this mouse is still working, but the flap on the thumb side is loose.",
      "The Logitech software is very annoying but once you have it set up with works great.",
      "Best mouse for MOBA. Decent quality. The plastic quality is not as good as G602 (old model) but wcyd. Theres an issue with the on board chip of this mouse. If you plan to use this mouse with no software it might bug out on you and click twice for every click you do. I'm not sure whats causes this to happen but if you run the software everything works perfectly. It has bluetooth and 2.5GH USB reciever so you can switch between 2 computers if you hold the wifi button for 1 sec.",
      "I love the overall feel of the mouse itself, and I like that it's wireless. However, I'm on my 2nd G604 mouse. Luckily, Logitech warranty is great. The side buttons make me continue to use this and non of the others.",
      "Since my g903 burnt down inside literally I wanted something fresh, I was already failiar with the G502 shape and the hero sensor from 903 but I wanted somthing different. I came up on this and It feels like a more refinded version of the g502. I had one issue wherethe right click was rubbing on something which got alleviated within a couple weeks"

      "Had a SteelSeries Rival 500 before which I loved but wanted to go for something wireless. This seemed like a logical choice and has so far been every bit as good as I'd hoped. I cannot tell any difference whatsoever in terms of lag when it's plugged in compared to when it's not, which is all I can say really!\nFor the price (still available the right side of £50) you can't go wrong.",
      "its not the lightest out there, but i like it, i like heavy mice. Only complaint would be the side rubber pieces, they seem to fall off after maybe a year of use. To fix it you can glue them back on like i did.",
      "Beautiful mouse, clean RGB design, great controlling software and battery lasts days (for my usage). Fits my hand really well and the adjustable weights is a nice touch. Controlling software and DPI/Profile settings are great for all types of games.",

      "Great wireless mouse at an acceptable price.",
      "No delay, perfect weight",
      "This is a good option for people who enjoy having a wireless mouse, and also being able to adjust the weights on it as well. It enjoys having the ability to be personalized in many ways through SteelSeries Engine 3, but keep in mind the RGB if you're always running wireless."
