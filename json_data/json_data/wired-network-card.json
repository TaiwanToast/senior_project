      "I bought this card thinking I'd prepare for the future. I have a 2.5Gbps router hard wired via CAT8 cable to the card and I get the advertised router max speeds of 2.5Gbps on the LAN but my 1Gbps WAN fiber connection isn't ready in the Republic of Ireland to upgrade to faster speeds in any direction in the near future so have yet to test its limits. We will see as time progresses if this was a worthwhile investment.",
      "Not this exact model (I used the Asus XG-C100F) but I assume it's more or less the same thing save for the SFP+ cage on the F model.\nBased on the Aquantia AQC107 chipset. Tested it with a few different SFPs and it appears to like all of them, so no vendor locking here. Can run at both 1G and 10G speeds. Picked this one because it is a fairly compact card thus not really blocking off the airflow to the GPU and has a decent heatsink.",

      "It's a fantastic idea but not a plausible market as an expansion card. It has its own processor for computing the sound, allowing your CPU to focus on other tasks. It helps give you a minor performance boost... but? $20 network stack optimizing software such as PGWare's Throttle can achieve half the results this $100 card can do.... Bigfoot Networks (who were bought out by Qualcomm) even state they don't support Linux...\nUnfortunately, no Linux drivers exist for the Killer 2100. The card was designed to improve Windows networking performance, and those restrictions don't exist in Linux, so a driver was not created. I'm afraid driver creation has ceased for this product (bug-fix support still exists), so there likely won't be a Linux driver coming.\nApologies for the inconvenience,\nEthan Senior Support Engineer Qualcomm Atheros www.killergaming.com\nref:_00D306grN._500a0h48HQ:ref"
