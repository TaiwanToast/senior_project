      "This is an amazing CPU! I haven't done too many benchmarks yet, but I directly compared it to my old 5900x in the Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark at 1080p Native, Lowest Settings, and it gave me exactly double the performance, which is pretty nutty. It also provided a 20% uplift in Cinebench R24 (both CPUs running with the Auto Overclock), which I didn't expect given the core count difference. The only issue I've found is that it runs really hot. I'm not sure if I need to reinstall my AIO or what, but in the same case with the same 360mm AIO, the 9800X3D can reach over 90 degrees under a heavy load, whereas my 5900x never exceeded 60 degrees. That's a huge difference, certainly more than I expected.",
      "Cinebench 2024 scores without any undervolt/overclock applied:\nMulti Core: 1292 pts\nSingle Core: 130 pts\nI was able to purchase this CPU in a bundle with the MSI MEG X670E ACE motherboard directly off of MSI's website. Not only did the bundle lower the cost of the 9800X3D ($435 as opposed to Amazon's $479), but I was also able to stack a 5% coupon code on top of the total cost of the bundle at the time. At the risk of sounding like an ad for MSI at this point, there was also no sales tax while shopping on their website :D\nSide note - in the picture I posted of all of the individual parts, the AMD box is missing because it's not included when you purchase the CPU as part of a bundle. Instead, it comes in the small plastic casing and taped to the exterior of the motherboard box.",
      "I thought the 7800x3d was good. This is even BETTER",
      "Best CPU for gaming, not much else to say. Was able to get a great open box deal at Micro Center making it cheaper than a 7800x3d making it an insane value. Huge improvement over the 5600x which was already a great cpu, making this one stand out even more.",
      "The 9800X3D was honestly the main reason for me wanting to build a new PC. It's seriously impressive . It's so effective at every task it's insane, and I haven't even tried to overclock it yet.",
      "Its a CPU. Does CPU things. Works.",
      "Great CPU, running it with PBO +200 and curve optimizer -10 to -30 (+ when benching 10x multiplier) on 5,426 Mhz. I upgraded from a 5800 x3d. Im glad the 3D cache is now build on top of the die so we can overclock it better :)",
      "Absolute beast!",
      "The best gaming CPU on the market. The performance in games is incredible and, frankly, unlike anything we've seen before. It does run a bit hotter at idle, during web browsing, and with simple tasks, but it's not a big deal. Huge recommend!",
      "I beast, runs a bit hotter than I would like when idle but when under load playing a demanding game like for example Inzoi, it stays around 50-60C"

      "Amazing CPU for single-core/thread performance. Not a bad choice for starting on the AM5 upgrade path too. Features very high clocks for its value when grabbing good deals.",
      "wish it could support the fastest speed for my ram only supports 5300 Mtz and mt ram is 6000Mtz",
      "A birthday gift from my wife; as a former big time console player I can't tell what's more CPU or GPU dependent, so I'm reviewing both as a collective. Struggles a bit when it comes to Monster Hunter Wilds, though said game has been struggling on many PC's tbh. Though eats older games I throw (Death Stranding, Helldivers 2, Palworld, Space Marine 2, Control) at it very handily. Great starter CPU to get into the AM5 platform and only plan on upgrading to an end of the line AM5 R7 or R7X3D.",

      "Fast, cool, and highly customizable performance. Worth the money if you're building an mITX build.",
      "Got it for a bundle price of around $165, for the performance you can't complain. Definitely runs warm, so I will probably end up undervolting. A bit overkill for my use cases but it was a great deal.",
      "I got it on sale with a free game at Micro Center. It is not a X3D CPU, but it isn't no slouch either. It is still a 8 core/16 thread CPU with a 32MD L3 cache.\nIt's still plenty fast and runs everything I throw at it.",
      "Plenty fast for an 8 core. It did peak at 95'C during Cinebench while hitting 5.3ghz. Put curve optimizer at -29 and temp limit of 84'C and it maintains 5525 mhz but under 80'C. Games like MH Wilds can make it peak at 83'C in short bursts and then down to 65'C. Most games it stays between 60-70'C. About 134W max TDP in rendering. Overall solid chip.",
      "Runs good but pretty hot, once under volted a little, she's golden",
      "So far the 9700X seems like a good part as long as you can get it at a price that's competitive to the 7700X/7700. This has been running Monster Hunter Wilds on high settings 1440p with the 5070 at about 40% CPU usage top during gameplay. Nothing to complain about here, just wouldn't personally recommend buying it for more than $30+ over the 7700/X as it sounds like the results are about the same unless you're concerned about energy savings/efficiency.",
      "Got one off Ali for 300, its a really good CPU.",
      "Absolute monster of a CPU. A 360mm AIO keeps it nice and chilly no matter the workload.",
      "My last build was a Ryzen, and so is this one. I have been doing a lot of C++ dev in recent years as well as gaming, so in an effort to reduce build times, I went for a Ryzen 7 over a Ryzen 5 this time. Works amazingly well. It idles surprisingly hot (44°C Idle), but the CPU cooler doesn't let it go above 82°C on the VDDCR_VDD VRM (the hottest temp) on a 10 minute cinebench run, so it is surprisingly easy to cool with an air cooler. Core temperatures rarely exceed 70°C. It is extraordinarily fast.\nRyzen master set to auto-overclocking mode is allowing boost speeds up to 5.6GHz on single cores, and around 5GHz across all cores running Cinebench. A more committed overclocker could definitely do better.",
      "Great CPU for a gaming rig and very solid when using for work/recording. For me, this CPU was only slightly more expensive than the 7700x that so many recommend. Paired it together with a 7800xt and I couldn't be happier :D\nPro tip: make sure the motherboard you are pairing with your CPU doesn't need a bios update to work with your CPU. I paired the 9700x with the MSI PRO X870-P WIFI ATX AM5 and all went well."

The 3D V-Cache really shines in gaming, offering ultra-low latency and smooth frame rates, while multi-threaded performance handles productivity tasks with ease. Paired with my Aorus Pro X870E, it runs cool and stable, especially with my Kraken Elite AIO keeping temps in check.\nDespite its power, it sips power efficiently compared to other high-end chips, and the plug-and-play experience was seamless.

Once you cross to the 4K gaming barrier, those gains become negligible as the GPU carries the workload.\nThe 7700X is a very affordable and capable CPU. It carries a full 8 cores, is multithreaded and overclocks well. It takes you over the budget CPU threshold into the high end and is perfect for a 4K gaming centric PC with modest to average productivity needs without the high price of the X3D CPUs.",

About as good as it gets for a CPU in this price range without spending another unnecessary 30$AUD on the X variant, or going up to the 7700 for an extra 150 for minimal performance increase. Doesn't bottleneck even the 9070.\nIt does run a little hot when doing fairly basic tasks like chrome browsing with multiple word docs open, or running MATLAB. With a cheap 240mm AIO it sits at about 41-45 doing that kind of stuff. Still well within normal ranges but just something to keep in mind if you want a quiet system",
      "For a cheap gaming/office PC, the Ryzen 5 7600 is a great value option with a good upgrade path. Obviously the X3D chips will give you better gaming performance, and the Ryzen 9 parts will give you better productivity performance, but those options are considerably more expensive, and suck down a lot more power. This thing sips a mere 65 W, can boost to 5.1 GHz, has six cores, and was half the price of the Ryzen 7 7700 at the time of purchase. 10/10 would recommend.",

      "Works smoothly, stays at C6 (the lowest C-state among C1, C2 & C6) almost every time. Probably overkill for my use case.\nNOTE: On NixOS, the AMD microcode in the official repos only include the EPYC and Threadripper microcode. For this CPU (and all other consumer AMD CPUs), I suggest using the ucodenix flake from GitHub, which uses the AMD-signed microcode published on platomav's GitHub repo. Also, you would have to either update your BIOS to the 2025-04-01 version, or lock the CPU microcode repository (not the flake) to the 0be0bd7b6a3ec1f1b59562729f1ce14b9569b697 commit.",

      "Extremely fast CPU for Gaming and Productivity. Plenty of misinformation about this CPU coming from big youtubers like GamersNexus, HardwareUnboxed and etc.\nLatest bios does not get rid of degradation. Manually tuning it does. Simply sync cores and undervolt via Loadline to prevent any sort of degradation.\nFor Best Gaming Performance. Get Windows 10 LTSC and Disable E Cores. For lower latency simply clock ring higher and tune your memory.",

      "Amazing for a high-end gaming, computer and overclocking I would highly recommend",
      "12/2/2024 Update: I just completed my bios update and was able to get a new processor from intel for free due to the instability flaw. I had no issues the first 6 months then it started to crash in certain games. (Helldivers, Forza, and BF2042), then I started to get random BSOD. I would bench test it and it would always pass 100%, I then would use the Intel Extreme tuner to dial down the Performance Ratio down by 3 and it never crashed after that. I finally contacted Intel customer support and opened a ticket and after several rounds of questions they agree to send me a new CPU. You have to pay $25 out of pocket for processing and then you must pay $600 for the replacement CPU, which they will fully refund once they receive the old/damaged one back. No BSOD and running at full ratio, so I guess I did have flawed CPU. And yes it runs hot, but seems to have gone down after reapplying thermal paste with the Noctua brand. On the bright side of things, I have been playing Stalker 2 on epic settings and have zero problems and everyone seems to have a ton of problems playing it.\nPro Tip: when cleaning up the old thermal paste, use the silver intel disk for packaging as tray to clean your pump head on so no debris falls into your case.",
      "Knowing an Intel employee we managed to get it for cheaper, and basically guaranteed help/replacement if anything goes wrong. So far so good, runs fast no issues.",
      "I don't usually review components in my builds, but for this processor I'll make an exception. This processor had initially been used for another computer, but something had gone wrong and the computer was showing signs of severe instability with blue screens and bootloops during startup. In the bios settings I had set the Intel settings by default, while later I had set automatic overclocking and activated XMP for the RAM memories. Thinking that the processor was faulty, I replaced it with another one, effectively obtaining a more stable system. At this point I thought that my Core i9 14900k was to be thrown away, given that the useful period for a possible return had already passed, but I wanted to give it a second chance by reusing it for this build. This time I wanted to keep the Intel settings, without imposing any changes in the bios, to understand if the processor was actually defective or not. Well, to my great surprise and relief, I was able to notice that not only was the 14900k fully functional, but that, without losing efficiency and speed, it had very low operating temperatures, which allowed me to have an extremely silent system. Now, it's clear that all this depends on Intel's highly limiting settings, but for me, since I don't use the PC to play, it's not that serious. All I need is for the computer to work well and smoothly. It's a real shame, however, to see Intel make these design errors and thus diminish the prestige it has worked hard to earn over the years... Having said that, I just wanted to testify to my experience with what I believe to be one of the most powerful processors currently on the market. Let's hope that Intel has learned its lesson and doesn't repeat the same mistakes with the next CPUs.",
      "I would avoid this chip at all costs. Go with AMD or get a i7-14700K. The 14900k crashes in games and has been reported to have a 50% fail rate. My cchip would not run most games, a few would run like Return to Moria. However.... Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption 2, Baldur's gate 3, Dragon's Dogma 2.... all crashed immediatelty.\nUpdate.... I changed my CPU to the 14700k and the issue persisted. I downgraded again to a 12900k. This resolved the crashing. I would avoid all 13th and 14th gen Intel processors. And moving forward I would never use them again based on how they are not dealing with their manufacturing issue in a ethical way.",
      "Runs hot as expected, the BIOS fixes were available when I purchased, so the first thing was to update BIOS and then again two weeks later when the second microcode update was released by Intel. Seems stable enough with a 40mV undervolt and the 240mm AIO, although still throttles in 5 cores using X-Plane 1 core playing Doom Eternal.",

      "Pretty much guaranteed for at least 60fps in almost every game out there and can be sourced used for cheap.",

Although it's not the most in-demand cpu on the market, its my personal favorite because of the low power usage and appropriate pricing.",

      "If you can get this on discount, it is one of the greats — high performance, great specs, and an overall gaming wizard.",
      "I got it for 150 bucks on sale. Incredible value. Has a good amount of L3 cache, support for PCIe 4 and has amazing multi threaded performance and solid single threaded performance. Easy to cool with its low 65 watt TDP and runs what ever I throw at it, would highly recommend.",
      "Works great, got it on a great deal and no issues with great performance to price",
      "I upgraded from a 5600G to this, and it really doesn't make a huge difference to me in most games, because they're GPU bottlenecked as it should. However, I don't know if it's due to the extra 4 threads or finally being able to turn on Smart Access Memory, but when I want to push a lot of frames in competitive shooters before it had some pretty severe 1% lows, like from 160fps down to 20, but now I don't get them at all!

      "For the price I got it for, it's fantastic.",
      "This is likely the best bargain for a general-purpose CPU at present, especially considering that it includes a nice Wraith Prism cooler in the box. The Wraith Prism cooler is the easiest cooler installation I've ever done, but make sure the bracket that comes pre-attached to your motherboard is screwed in tight before locking it in! You can improve both the performance and power efficiency of Ryzen 7000 CPU's by undervolting with the Curve Optimizer, and that is what I recommend doing if you can spare the time. Alternatively, you can mix the Curve Optimizer with Precision Boost Overdrive to get maximum performance at expense of power efficiency.",

It did not come with the stock cooler so I temporarily bought a $10 one until I could afford the liquid cooler I got. I just want to make it clear you do not need a liquid cooler the $10 cooler I got was doing just fine I just didn't like how it looked.",
      "8-core CPU doesn't use much power and performs as expected. AM5 platform means significant upgrade potential. On top of that, it doesn't rust. Cooler was slightly annoying to install (very unorthodox mounting mechanism) but does its job."

Furthermore, the clock speed difference between this unit vs 7600/7600x can be overcome by playing with the PBO limits. I have experimented with this in my build and shared the results but unless you enjoy doing it, overclock/undervolt is not required.\nNOTE:\nIt does not have integrated graphics (indicated by the 'F' at the end).\nIt is an OEM/Tray unit so it does not come with a stock cooler.\nLet's be real, were you really gonna use the stock cooler??\nRefer:\nThe ULTIMATE Gaming CPU Tier List for 2024!\n7800X3d VS 7500F Underdog Champ\nI highly recommend watching this video before dropping $$$ on expensive CPUs.\nNo shade on 7800X3D, it is a great CPU (probably one of the best gaming CPUs you can buy rn) but is expensive compared to 7500F and offers negligible performance increase in 1440P gaming when paired with a suitable GPU.\nProductivity is situational and depends entirely on your definition of the word.",

      "Fantastic budget CPU that runs great and has plenty of cores to run most modern games.",
      "Good",
      "got this for around $180 which i thought was a good deal. went with the KF rather than K bc i didn't see a reason to pay extra for integrated graphics since i'm already getting a gpu. runs games pretty well so no complaints with this cpu.",
      "realy fast for a mid budget build",
      "Great CPU for gaming, had no issues with it! Great thermals, and extremely performant for its price bracket.",
      "nice for price",
      "Great CPU with pretty good thermals! But if you're not on a tight budget, I would recommend purchasing the K version instead of the KF; this allows you to use the integrated graphics if your dedicated GPU fails.",
      "Great CPU with only occasional hiccups, which are probably my fault for the poor cooling job I did.",
      "Very good processor that does exactly what it's supposed to do. However, unless you know what you're doing, get the K instead of the KF. The KF has no integrated graphics, something that I didn't notice, so my PC didn't start without my graphics card inserted.",
      "I'm very happy with this so far. Got it for an amazing price at Overclockers and the performance is comparable to higher rated processors and stable. 10/10, does exactly what I need it to do."

      "Great performance, and easy upgrade from the Ryzen 3000 series processors (Your motherboard will most likely need a BIOS update, if you're not upgrading that component too btw).",
      "many people say this isnt a great gaming cpu but honestly.. in most titles it goes beyond the 5800x and it sometimes rivals the x3d chips.. those 4 extra cores are gonna be great for background stuff too.",

      "VERY FAST love this CPU. With the right cooler it stays under 65C most of the time even when gaming.\nHave it OC running around 4.4 GHz.\nHope to keep this one around 5 years untill I upgrade again",

      "When I saw it was $205 USD on Amazon I knew it was time to upgrade from my 5820k. Was #2 on cpubenchmark value at the time. Does everything I need even if it runs a bit hot. Knocked off a star because Ryzen Master has been a pain to work with.",

      "14600k is basically just the 13600k but a few extra bucks but I said screw it and just got the more recent version. It has plenty of cores and power for what I'm doing and has worked well so far.",
      "Good cpu, if I was buidling from scratch I would likely go for a 7800x3d",
      "Especially for ITX system and smaller CPU coolers I recommend configuring power limits in the BIOS. With default CPU settings the temperatures reached quickly 100 °C and thermal throttling kicked in. You could blame either Intel or Mainboard manufactures to let the CPU consume as many power as they want. however.. The Intel Core i5-14600K offers a good \"bang for the buck\". Even with Powerlimits down to 70W - 80W you don't have significant performance drops. I was able to undervolt my CPU to an Vcore Offset of -0,11V (After that, I had no desire to test even lower settings anymore) I have these settings permanently: Internal CPU Vcore Offset: -0,07 V Package Power L1 and L2: 75 W I'm absolutely satisfied with the CPU."

      "If you're only gaming, this is probably not the CPU for you, but it offers faster productivity performance than raptor lake (significantly faster than my specific raptor lake processor which degraded heavily :/) and it offers roughly the same gaming performance. hopefully the changes from raptor lake to arrow lake (foveros chip design, more powerful efficiency cores, the end of hyperthreading, manufacturing by tsmc, etc.) give arrow lake better longevity than raptor lake and offer a fresh start for intel to build off of in the future.",
      "Solid gaming chip! Coming from a 12700k mainly used for gaming and content creation. This chip is efficient, powerful and future proof. Kinda funny how a few YouTubers make some bad videos about this chip and everyone follows suite. O well their loss!",
      "Writing this review after 3 days of owning it, so I can't say much. Thanks to all the negative reviews, I got this for a good price. I don't game much, so for me it's plenty fast. So far for photo and video editing it works perfectly. Doesn't get hot.",
      "I know many reviews make look bad this CPU, but everything changes when you get it at a good price. I was able to grab it for $230 thanks to a MicroCenter deal. For what it offers, it's a solid choice for gaming and has been a great performer overall. In terms of productivity, this little chip has been a lifesaver. My only hope is that Intel makes good use of their NPU, as it could lead to significant improvements for budget PCs in the future as for now those npu are very useless.",
      "Bought my Core Ultra 265k at Microcenter for $230 + tax. Userbenchmark score of 138% air cooled right out of the box which is on par with the 14900k average. Thanks to all the negative publicity this new chip went on sale. Looking at the new microcode bios updates; the future is bright for this cpu."

Stock cooler doing good enough at least so far with some intensive games (never crossed 77degC on the CPU). For CAD and simulation workloads, 10 cores help a lot tho not as much as the usual Xeon 24C/48T CPUs that are made specifically for such workloads.",
      "A terrific value still even with the inflated pricing compared to previous generations. You get more cores and amazing power consumption. I wish it did not come with a stock cooler though as it's inadequate for heavier workloads like video rendering, often reaching 95C. A hyper 212 or equivalent does the trick!",

      "This is a solid CPU. 10 Cores (6P/4E) is great for any productivity tasks or creative workloads, and the single-core performance is great for 1440p gaming. There's not as much of an upgrade path as the new Ryzen 5 7600, which is offered at a similar price, but it's still great nonetheless due to a higher core count, having cheaper motherboard options, and having more RAM stability.\nCinebench R23 Multi-Core Score: 11852\nBlender CPU Benchmark: 106.16",

The temps are a bit high with the stock cooler, would recommend aftermarket, was the same on my previous CPU too. It'd have been nice to get a CPU with an integrated GPU(like the i5-12400 which was significantly cheaper) so I could use it for troubleshooting and hardware accerelation on Chrome for the second monitor because it's broken on AMD gpus kinda. There were some good AM4 alternatives that I could have picked like the 5600x but I don't strongly regret my decision because at least I'm familiar with Intel platforms more and provide overall more stability and the performance is a bit better even if not in price, plus said alternatives don't have iGPUs mostly too and AM5 is DDR5-only. It's a fine budget gaming GPU, but it should be priced 200$ at the very max.",

      "The AM4 Game Changer.\nThe very first X3D CPU is still relevant years later. They've iterated and innovated and improved, but the venerable 5800X3D is still pumping out high framerates, and punching above its weight. Limited by lack of OC potential, but if it did all that they'd have to give it 6 stars.",
      "Fantastic CPU for my use case which is coding, LLM toying with ollama, gaming (msfs 2020, DCS) and light video editing from time to time. Got it at bargain 330€ price last year and swapped with a 5600 (non X) that went to my other half desktop. A bit tough to keep cold with the noctua air cooler so I decided to cross the pond and go for liquid cooling with a 240mm that keeps it just fine.",
      "-30 offset on all cores using pbotuner2, for a good undervolt. Runs at a cool 78 degrees under max load, while clocking at 4.43ghz on a single tower air cooler. Pretty good! Also its worth a lot more money now than what I paid for it, soooo it could potentially fund an upgrade.",
      "Incredible performance boost in games.",
      "Beast of a CPU. Managed to get all cores on -30 PBO offset, and lowered power draw limits, which led me to have even better performance with better temperatures.",
      "Genuinely a great cpu have had issues with the temps but that’s solely based on the kraken 360 wish I would have gone arctic",
      "Endgame CPU on AM4 platform for gaming",
      "An all-around absolute beast of a CPU. This one will almost definitely be the CPU equivalent of the GTX 1080 Ti, the way it will probably never start showing its age."

      "Works like a charm :) I don't like loud fans, max temps or inneficient CPUs so I have it limited to either 90ºC or 185W, while also having a quiet fan curve. During summer the 90ºC limit is reached first, while now during winter the power limit is reached and the CPU hovers around 80-85ºC during all-core load. Also undervolted per-core, with some going as high as -40 in CO and some unlucky ones almost no undervolt without being unestable. The second CCD (the slow one) fared much better in undervolting results.",
      "AMD sent the Chip in great condition and it runs great, it is certainly not bottlenecking anything, it is very fast, installed the CPU gently and had no issues.\nWhen it came to picking a CPU for my system, I wanted one that was powerful. I tried to pick one that I knew would be good at handling high loads as well as being able to keep up with my 5080. I was also aware that this CPU in particular gets hot sometimes, and I was ok with that because I knew I needed an efficient cooler anyway, but this core doesn't pass 80°C unless you are loading something pretty large or using it for heavy processing. I could have gone with a newer Gen CPU, but I kind of saw this one, and I think for my budget and saving 300$, this one brings a very high level of performance and can keep up with the newer gen systems at an affordable price. I will add that your general room temperature plays a huge role in how hot this thing can get, if your room is warmer because its summer time then it might get very hot duh.",

      "For the price it was a no brainer at the time, the i5 and Ryzen 5600 (3600 or Ryzen 3 were not options) were too expensive, and the performance really does not dissapoint. I'd consider upgrading if possible, but it's not necessary.",
      "Excellent value processor which is still more than capable in 1080 gaming and everyday tasks. The main advantage is its price and low TDP of only 65W.",
      "Solid little gaming beast for under $100",
      "The 12100f features the Alder Lake micro-architecture and has quad core design. It is an entry level processor, but performs well in benchmarks and can give older quad core i5s and i7s a tough challenge, or even outright beat them. It achieved a great score in Cinebench R23, with multi-core performance at 8138 points, and single core performance at 1586 points.\nWith that being said, it is still an entry level processor, only having 4c/8t comparing to other budget options such as the Ryzen 5 5500 (Having 6c/12t), Ryzen 5 5600G(6c/12t) and the i5-12400f (6c/12t). Still have stellar gaming performance, but there are other options avaliable. Price to performance is amazing.",
      "For the price, the i3 12100F is incredible value. I bought it at $95 but it can drop to $85, which is even better. Strongly recommend for those that want to put together a system on a tight budget, especially over the 13100F and 14100F, since the performance uplift isn't notable, yet they cost much more.\nKeep in mind that I bought this CPU in March/April before the news with Intel's 13th and 14th gen chips being unstable on higher end SKUs. I can't say I recommend buying into LGA 1700 anymore, but please do your research.\nAlso, make sure to get a CPU contact frame to prevent motherboard warping! I have a Thermalright contact frame and it works great (good price point too).",
      "It will bottleneck in games like Cyberpunk but for easy to run games it's perfect. Using it with RX 6600. Hard to beat for the price. Only needs around 50W so it stays cool.",
      "Decent price & performance. Comes with finally a somewhat acceptable stock cooler (Intel Laminar Coolers), has nice single core performance. It is a really bad CPU for anything multicore, as it's only a 4/8 CPU.",

      "None of that 3D cache magic that the 5700X3D and 5800X3D have going on. But my 5800XT was only $140. In terms of non-gaming raw performance, it technically outperforms the 5800X3D too. After all, it's got the highest single threaded performance out of any AM4 CPU, according to Passmark at least. But it's also a very toasty chip. Reminds me of AMD's 220W FX-9590 days."

      "Despite the Intel hate and its issues, I had gone with it anyway. It works fine for gaming, and productivity, yet I wonder how long it will last since the BIOS \"fix\" didn't really fix it for most people. And unfortunately I bought a dead socket, so no future upgrading :(",
      "For due diligence, I did a deep dive into Intel’s over-volting & oxidation problem. Although I haven’t experienced any issues. I do consider myself lucky. There’s a lot of contradictory information about this online though. & while It was hard to parse out what was opinion or fact. I’m certainly not the only one who’s had a positive experience with the 14th series. But, I digress; your experience may vary. Ultimately, I decided I’d stick to Intel defaults & implement an offset.",
      "Very fast CPU. I have had no problems with it. Just remember to update your BIOS to the new fix Intel put out to keep your CPU from exploding. Only downside is you cannot overclock this CPU because the fix for it, was to essentially underpower it. However it is very powerful and no game has even remotely come close to maxing this CPU out.",
      "Good cpu, does everything I need, the instability problems did not affect me at all, but I got the BIOS update that fixes the instability to make sure.",
      "Hasn't crashed yet, and performs great",
      "Got it with MSI bundle deal along with the Ace motherboard. It was an OEM part so no box or packaging. So far so good with temp. I used Intel AI tool for overclock, again no issues.",
      "Runs well, puts out power, no problems with it.",
      "Just get the K, no F, even if you are getting a standalone video card. The integrated graphics and the separate GPU actually work together. Other than that, blazing fast, but also blazing hot. For general use in a creator PC, you might not be thermally limited with an air cooler, but for heavy 3D or gaming you'll need a big AIO. Also jeeeez they're not kidding about the flaws with LGA 1700's mounting systems! I stalled in a hot sweat for like 20 minutes on this build, because I just could not believe the amount of pressure I was having to apply to get that wonky lever down, with the bracket holding the CPU in the socket just jingle-jangling around. I only found out about flat-plates AFTER doing the build, otherwise I would have incorporated one.",
      "An absolute monster. It doesn't have intergrated graphics but that is what my 4090 is for. It fixed every issue that I was having and it runs great. Other reviews say that it runs hot. I have just started using it but will make sure there is always lots of airflow to help keep it running as cool as can be.",
      "To me, this is a great jump from my OCed i7 2600k cpu. I see a lot of potential for overclocking this thing for years to come. Hopefully I can get some good performance from this."

Strange. Although they call them computers, that’s not what they primarily do. They primarily are filing systems. ¶ People in the computer business say: “They’re not really computers, they’re DA-TA HAND-LERS.” Alright, that’s nice. Data handlers would have been a better name because it gives a better idea of the idea of a filing system where there’s a lot of data on cards and you handle it, you take cards out, look at them, put them back, and so on.\nThere’s an Intel Core i7-13700K 3.4 GHz 16-Core Processor in Interwebs Communotron 2023. It has worked without issues since building the machine in the end of 2023, so I’m satisfied.",

Upgrading from a 10700k, the difference is night and day.\nI've personally never had any temp issues even with heavy gaming, but it definitely does get hot so be sure to pair with a well-equipped cooling solution.",

      "Found it to be a well-worth upgrade from my i5-9400f. Currently overclocking to where it consistently runs around 5.0Ghz and does not get hotter than 70 C while gaming or heavy loads and idles around 45-50 C (due to the Intel Turbo Boost)",

      "AMAZING FOR THE PRICE. This has everything you need to get started and the integrated graphics are very good for waiting to buy a GPU, Intel could never get their integrated graphics this good for this cheap. Included cooler is great, I still use it (once again, Intel can't even compete).",

      "Awesome for the price, the Vega 8 integrated graphics can even do some light gaming!",
      "absolutely smashed my expectations with the vega 8 iGPU minecraft ran at 50 fps while on a busy server (with optifine) and all eSport games ran at 50-80 fps at min. while i was waiting for a gpu this worked perfectly. -1 star is because it wasnt zen 2 and the lack of SMT killed VR gaming for me.",
      "I have reviewed this before in a different build and I hold that while integrated graphics generally leaves a lot to be desired, Ryzen is doing an amazing job with it.\nOriginally (Jan 2020) I had bought this first hand at £77 and it has continued to be worth a lot more to me than this. It plays most games at 1080p/30fps with some tweaking and I haven't had it throttled due to heat even with stock coolers."

Luckily, the 7600x3D is available here (probably air-flown from the US lol). Very nice. I haven’t done and probably not going to do any over-clocking or anything toooo CPU-intensive, so I can’t tell you guys if it’s worth the money, but I sure have saved plenty of money by choosing the 7600X3D.

      "Solid and efficient",
      "This CPU is fantastic! Hopefully AMD creates another one for the 9000 series with the same power consumption to performance ratio.",
      "Thanks to the madman friend for getting me this for Christmas. I'm upgrading from a Ryzen 7 7700x, which is pretty good all on its own.\nWhat I wanted was more cores for less power, and this chip pretty much hits that sweet spot. 12 cores & 24 threads, while running at 65 watts. This monster merely SIPS power, it's insane. Even better, because it's 65 watts, it's never hot. Max temps top out at around 65 degrees Celsius. So for the amount of CPU horsepower I get, while running as cool as a fridge, for a fraction of the power consumption, this is THE pinnacle of performance per watt that you can buy for AM5, or Ryzen in general. There is also Intel, but uhhh...yeah...\nIt's also fairly underrated. No one ever seems to talk about this one, yet every review I've seen has given this model great marks. I think this would be a great option for a lot of people, if it wasn't for one big caveat.\nThe one and probably only major flaw of this CPU is its heavy price tag. Retailing for about $400, it is a hefty bitter pill to swallow. Not to mention, its gaming performance isn't much different nor better than what you'll get with the other options. Even my outgoing 7700x can outpace the 7900 at certain tasks.\nFor those who have deep pockets and big budgets, go bananas. You will not find a better alternative to a high-core-count, power efficient AM5 CPU than this one. As for everyone else who is poor like me, don't worry about it. The other Ryzen CPUs will work perfectly fine, for much less cash, no less.\nOverall, I'm happy with this CPU. Unless AMD makes a low power X3D chip like this, there are no further CPU upgrades needed for me. This is my ultimate endgame chip, one that I hope to run for many more years to come.",
      "I determined that a Ryzen 9 7900 would be ideal for my build, with several threads for multitasking and better single-core performance than the 7800X3D at nearly half the wattage.",
      "I've been pleased with the performance and have not noticed any issues, however, I did upgrade from the stock AMD cooler to a Thermalright Peerless Assassin air cooler. Handles games and video editing load fine.",
      "Ridiculously power efficient and 24 juicy logical cores. Perfect for contemporary gaming (as of 2024) and perfect for a future hand-me-down home server.",
      "This CPU is a fiend with and without PBO. With PBO, good cooling, and the right configuration this will hit as high as 5.5GHz and possibly higher. Without PBO this will still perform flawlessly in most non CPU heavy tasks (like gaming).",
      "Great CPU for gaming and productivity. If you have a choice between the 7900 and the 7900X, go for the cheaper one. The included cooler is nice, but I would opt for a more powerful aftermarket cooler.",
      "Very powerful and efficient chip. Going to stick with 65 watt AMD chips moving forward since I really value efficiency and power.",

      "I've only ran for about 6 months as of today but so far I have no complaints. Great gaming chip and undervolting helps the temps out very nicely. I get that AMD has better options for gaming, but when on sale it's typically less than AMD's 7700x, which definitely starts a good debate. Especially if you plan on doing non-gaming related activities. Also, the i5-13600KF is usually discounted at an even better price if you don't need the insurance of onboard graphics.",

      "Works well and stays very cool using my LT520 AIO. No stability issues yet so we'll see if I run into those... iGPU is nice for the Quicksync support in video editing and streaming, it destroys in the video editing that I've done with it! Probably wouldn't recommend just because it could have stability issues but I'm not going to drop the rating because of that since it hasn't happened yet.",
      "No issues so far but since all the issues with 13th and 14th gen chips started, I can’t give it 5 stars in case it has issues",
      "This CPU has been used for 2/3 years through multiple builds and I must say that it has not been a very good experience. Already because I was using it on a bad motherboard and because I was using an option from MSI which restricted it (CPU LOAD LITE - Mode 1) but overall it was not suitable for my use (competitive games 1440p at very high FPS > 240hz) and feels less smooth than competitor or new 14th gen CPU's from Intel. i don't really recommend this CPU.",

      "I purchased this part for $275 August of 2023, easy install into the MOBO and pleasantly surprised with performance in gaming and as a workstation. Choosing this over the 13700k or opting to go 7800x3D allowed me to fit a 7900xtx in my build instead of a 7900xt or 4070Ti. I cannot complain.

      "Thank you Ryzen for taking Intel out of the quad core dark ages, It was the greatest gaming CPU at the time and I OC'ed it to 4.9ghz without too much problem. Only real issues is that my only upgrade on this platform is a 9900k which isn't that much better in gaming.",
      "Quick to shred through any workload I throw at it. As a former low end gamer (some might argue THIS is also low end lol), I only know low end titles, so I couldn't really stress test to the very extreme.\nSo far, it's never bottlenecked on anything. If you can pick it up for cheaper/same price as a 3600, it would make for a great value build.",
      "Breath of fresh air after years of Quad-Core i7s.",
      "Solid cpu, cant complain about it at all",
      "This is a really solid CPU, Intel did a great job here. The only thing I dislike is it holds back the GPU but that's because this an older CPU paired with a 4080!",
      "This is the CPU that brought Intel out of the dark days of quad-core i7s and into the age of some halfway modern processing power. A great CPU in its day and aged like fine wine. Still plenty powerful for the vast majority of users today, on par with or slightly better than a Ryzen 3600X at stock and much more tunable.\nPros: Good performance, proven platform, durable. Early (pre-8086K) examples in particular are supremely overclockable.\nCons: A little picky about memory, thermal issues caused by TIM drying up requiring a delid on severely degraded examples, i7 tax on the used market, high power draw compared to more modern Ryzen equivalents.\nIf you get a good deal on a used one of these, go for it! It'll do well for a gamer or someone looking to build a cheap home workstation, even half a decade on from its release.",
      "Been bulletproof for 4-5 years now. Have it overclocked to 4.8 Ghz don't really remember the settings it has been 4 years since i oced. Pretty awesome still running great just wish I had more cores.",
      "Still does what I need it to do in 2023.",
      "Very good, has withstood the test of time, can take everything with ease.",

If I stress test it, it gets to 80c, but that's just not the real world experience I have with it, and that's fine enough as is. Real world, I haven't seen it more than peak at 75c, and typically holds at 50c during my heaviest day to day use cases. 90% of the time though, it just idles, never really exceeding 30c. It's far more than what most people need. The more modern CPUs are unnecessary if this is what an almost 4 year old CPU does these days, and it's half the price of those monsters.",

      "Excellent processor with very efficient 6 cores. At the time of my build I heard about problems with additional e-cores in more powerful CPUs when by mistake e-cores were \"given\" heavier tasks by the controller (instead of p-cores) worsening overall performance in some games. I hope this has been fixed by now but I still think 6 cores is enough for a gaming PC. Again, the 12th generation of Intel processors was probably the best in terms of quality as some of the 13th and 14th generation intel processors were failing due to manufacturing defects. Lastly, this CPU is officially only 65W making it very easy to cool with a simple air cooler, and the price of i-5 12400 has come down now I would still recommend it for a budget build even in 2024.",
      "Very good CPU, outperforms my own 10th gen i7 and helps increase the pc's longevity.",
      "Great price/performance ratio. I hesitated between this and a 5600X for some time, but finally decided the Intel way would be better at productivity tasks while having better upgrade options than a AM4 platform.",
      "lol can't overclock but I had this in an Asus Prime B660 so it wasn't needed at the time.",
      "Great CPU, runs very cool it's all you need for gaming.",
      "it does cpu things like gaming",
      "Went with Intel for it's known stability and good performance. Did not need the small improvement to 13th gen which cost more and I wouldn't even really use the extra performance.\nMost definitely recommend going for a CPU that has integrated graphics as redundancy and in my case, needed it to setup the PC since for whatever reason, my GPU wasn't being picked up by the monitor until after I installed the drivers.",
      "It was a fantastic and capable bargain when it was new and kinda still is!",
      "best mid range 12th generation i5 considering its price",
      "Thought I would've bought Raptor Lake non-K but it's not happening so this instead, SA voltage is limited so currently only running at DDR4-3333, like why Intel : ("

      "It doesn’t have the most groundbreaking performance or anything, but it’s good for the price. It literally cost less than my motherboard did. There’s no integrated graphics but that’s not a big deal.",
      "You wouldn't expect a CPU with 4-cores to do decently in games, but this one does. Even in CPU-heavy games such as modded Minecraft and modded Cities: Skylines, it still performs much better than the i5-2400 that was originally in here, and it performs just as good as my other build with a Ryzen 5 3600.",
      "We opted for the i3-13100F because of it's price/performance ratio and budget considerations. The PC is used mostly for my son's gaming (Fortnite, Valorant) and basic video editing. We figured that if our old i7-930 could barely handle these tasks, this one would boost the performance greatly. Which, after a few hours of use, it turned out to be the case. Son is very happy of the FPS output.\nThe CPU came with the stock-fan (I actually did not notice when I bought it), but we decided to use a Cooler Master Hyper H412R instead.",
      "Great entry gamer, good enough for starting out, but will bottleneck mid to high end GPUs at 1080p, even some at 1440p. But its a great starting off point for LGA1700 (and you'll have a ton of upgrade options) Keep any eye on pricing though, and only get this over the 12100f if they are within a few bucks of each other. (you'll only see a max of about 5% gaming performance between a 12100f and 13100f)",
      "Absolute beast of a CPU. Do not be fooled by its 4 cores or its I3 branding. This thing performs amazing. With turbos up to 4.4GHz, this thing shreds at every workload you throw at it. It's great for day to day use, 1080p gaming, and light productivity. It also doesn't get that hot or loud, so the stock cooler is perfectly adequate. This, plus the overclocked 5600xt, can easily drive my 144hz monitor. Do not underestimate this CPU, especially for its $150 price tag. Its great for budget builds, will be recommending to many others. Definitely a 5 star product."

      "Never complaining about a free CPU.",
      "It's great for gaming, phenomenal performance for it's price. Unfortunately it doesn't handle rendering massive projects so I am only giving it 4 stars. If you are building just a gaming setup, buy the i5-13400, if you have plans for anything more, buy better.",
      "Great CPU, does not produce a ton of heat with a decent CPU cooler. Perfect for gaming",
      "worked very good but tbh with my cooler its getting 90+ degrees so i think its best with a good cooler unlike mine",
      "Does its thing, easy to install, and is living up to where it sits in the Intel lineup. A seemingly good match to the 6750 XT and has shown to run very cool.\nDespite the 13600 being only $20 more, I went with this as I was aiming for a very cool and quiet running machine without having to deal with any underclocking challenges.\nIt exceeds with this requirement. With the paired 240MM AIO, this easily stays in the 20s at idle and maxes in the 50s. This lets my fans stay quiet, even silent, when under load.\nThis is not the most glorious CPU in Intel's lineup, but it fits a great niche for my needed purposes and I'd certainly recommend it. It has yet to faulter in any scenario I've put up against it. A note, I was still aiming for a DDR4 setup and the AM5 boards/memory are driving build prices through the roof for only marginal gains (at present) - and the LGA1700 socket was still much more plentiful in ITX options and price points.\nThis CPU should be a solid performer for me for years to come.\nMicrocenter didn't carry the \"F\" variant, but the price was still lower than anywhere else's \"F\" variant so just went with it anyway. While I certainly don't use the embedded graphics, I benchmarked with it for fun, you can see the image/results in my build. It would certainly be serviceable for day-to-day if that was all the need was for. It was a bit handy to have this during the build so I could get it up and running before adding the riser into the mix."

      "I already hear the youtubers crying about this choice because apparently I should've waited 2 extra months for the release of a CPU I didn't even know about at the time. But supposedly this CPU is bad in most games, but watch me crush my FAVORITE games at 120fps with my 2gb of VRAM vega 11 crap (+ GPU crisis)",
      "Works well for an HTPC build, web browsing, watching videos and the included wraith stealth cooler is enough to cool this APU. Never had any issues with this processor as it is fast enough for its use case.",
      "Great Budget CPU and I was able to play smaller games at consistent 60-75 Hz after I upgraded my PC to 16gb of ram. Small games are still playable with 8gb but can get pretty choppy sometimes. All games have to be played on low settings though. (The games I play usually don't need that much graphical power but I was able to play apex legends with 16gb of system ram)",

I was not expecting it to be this good, it runs pretty much all the games I play at 60 fps or more. Not as good as getting a graphics card but definitely good enough for midrange builds to budget builds.",
      "Because GPU pricing and availability is so awful right now I chose this 3400G with integrated Vega 11 graphics. That way I can game without a discrete GPU and the AM4 socket allows for future upgrades. Temps are good. Drivers are good. Getting decent framerates in Forza, Halo, Doom and GTA5. Nothing spectacular - low settings 1080p - but good enough. I didn't expect too much from an entry-level APU but I'm happy to say it is better than expected.",

It doesnt run hot at all when paired with Arctic 420mm AIO, not seen it go above 60C. 2 years later and it still hasnt degraded or had any crashes that are expected from the 13th and 14th gen of Intel CPUs. Would still go with an AMD system if you ask me, the extra V-cache on the 3D CPUs is too good to miss out on for gaming!",
      "Coming from an Intel Core i5 (7th gen) it would be difficult not to say that this CPU just blows it away ... probably the best price/performance I could find at the time and within my budget",
      "No issues with cooling, performs well; Didn't even need to under volt it.",
      "Really solid performance, far better value than the 14th gen chips. Needs a solid cooling setup but will crush any games you throw at it.",
      "Top tier performance, as always from Intel. This thing chunks anything that you throw at it with ease.",
      "Fast. Very good, when properly cooled with aio, thermal paste, and lga 1700 bracket.",

      "A very strong cpu for anything, quite expensive and would only recommend for those doing heavy workloads.At time of writing, if you're gaming, AMD is a good option for those with a budget.",
      "Perfect for 4070 (Unfortunately it performs like my i3 10th gen for some reason).",

      "Don't overpay for this in 2021/2022. It's insane to me seeing people continue to pay the price of an i5-12600K for these. Can still be a decent budget option if found for a low enough price (wouldn't go over $80 honestly, since it needs a beefier motherboard and cooler than an i3-10100 to deliver roughly the same performance).",
      "When I bought it back in 2016 this was the bomb, however in 2021 I can't recommend it unless you get it pretty cheap.",

No issues in 3 years (I haven't overclocked it at all), and the temps are fine with my Hyper 212 (72-75 under load, I also have 6 case fans). 3 years later, I haven't replaced thermal paste or anything, it scores 2268 on Cinebench (Their benchmark for this CPU is 2420).",
      "It's still fine considering Intel haven't chance IPC in 5 years and still remain competitive. Overclocked at 4.8 it's matching 3300X and beating 10320. In many games would actually perform within 2-3% of stock 10600k, so it's still too early for an upgrade. My chip though happened to be on the worse end it can't go higher than 4.8 at 1.370V, but temps under stress load are just 70\nHowever I almost wish I bought my PC in 2018 when 8700k was out lol Or 2019 when the whole spectrum of 3600/3700x/3900x was out",

      "I mean.. it's a decent mid-high end CPU, what is there to say? it handles Stormworks, Beam.NG and Teardown very well, compared to the 5600g I was running it is quiet great.\nI mean.. I absolutely lucked out with this though, after I had bought everything on amazon and woke up I realized I hadn't bought a CPU- I can only assume because the prices were absolutely wonky, most 7800's were above 400, the 7950 was pushing 500, looked locally and saw one of these in box for 180$, a steal really.\nI am aware of its lackluster performance in comparison to those two but for the price I will not complain.",
      "This has pretty much destroyed anything I've thrown at it from gaming to any Adobe software/Blender to encoding for streams. Doesn't run too hot since I havn't dipped into any kind of overclocking and I have a pretty decent AIO liquid cooler on it.",
      "This is an amazing processor, 12 cores - 24 threads, future proof baby.",
      "Considering the price I got this for, it's a steal. Good power efficiency and 12 cores make this thing not only easy to cool but able to handle everything I throw at it. At MSRP I can hardly recommend this though, and would have gone for the 7800X3D if this hadn't been cheaper at the time.",
      "Why would one buy this? Because it was $400 CAD at the time and I thought, \"you know, I like weird parts, and everyone says this is weird\". Also, this was about $100 CAD less than the 7800X3D. Now, that is the best gaming, yes, I get it (at time of build). But I wanted more cores. I am looking at this as I am buying a 7600X and then another 7600X3d for around $140. I am not going for the ultra RTX 4090 build and that level of performance, so not caring on the gaming side. Also, it can do better for some games because of the extra cores, but that is rare. There could be CCD issues. Mostly, for $400 I was willing to try it. I am not disappointed so far. This only sucks about ~10 watts for office and normal work. Even at full load, I am only pulling ~65W. I tried a -30 volt underclock. That didn't quite stick (had some random shut downs) so went to -25 volt. Running beautifully.",
      "Superb CPU. very fast and very cool running. I am blown away.",
      "Very nice choice, not much more expensive than the 7800x3d. Although it Is slower, gaming isn't as important to me, I value the 12 cores much more than gaming performance. Still performs amazing for the price."

      "High spec at the time I bought it. It's held up quite well and I don't have performance issues. It can comfortably handle boosting to 4.4GHz and idle at 32-40C (room temp is around 21C). Go for something newer at the same price point like a 5800X3D or better if you're thinking about getting one of these full price.",

      "Absolute gem from AMD, while not worth its price anymore still holds up great in terms of performance. Zen 2 still does not disappoint, handles 3D emulation, 1080p/4K video editing, and 240Hz gaming all with few hiccups. still, if you're on the search, consider the next-gen-over 5800x for $300 CAD or the equally priced 5800X3D for far better gaming performance.",
      "Love this CPU, very fast with a nice low price point. No sense in spending the extra money for a Ryzen 9, when it is only 2-5% faster. This also comes with the nice RGB Wraith Prism Cooler, very sweet.",

      "Hasn't caused me a single problem. No complaints.",
      "Used as an alternative for the 5600x since that thing was getting scalped sky high when I originally built this system. Great cpu, does everything I want it to at a good speed. Just make sure you get sufficient cooling, it runs extremely hot"

Editing on this CPU (My main usecase) Is as smooth as butter,\nthe only problem with this chip is, it gets TOASTY, im using a Corsair AIO with this CPU and she reaches temps up to 85°c (Video Editing/Rendering). I had to adjust my fan curves, because running Geekbench, temps got up to 100°c, after adjusting the temps ive seen got to a max of 85°c, and havent seen it go above that,\nWhen it comes to Gaming, even using GTA V Ultra realism mods, it doesnt get above 75°c\noverall, beast of a chip, but you NEED a water cooler, eather Custom loop or AIO.",

It also gets extremely hot and this and pretty much all i9 chips require liquid cooling. Although for a workstation this CPU is great, it’s strong and capable. So overall if you want a strong workstation CPU— then this is a good purchase. But if you are mostly gaming I would get something like the $400 Ryzen 7 7800X3D.",

      "There's a reason why most top-level PC builds use some variety of this. It's one of the best currently available and it's priced as such. The thing is, however, that this chip and it's other varieties (the K, KS, and non-K) are absolutely overkill for 4k gaming. However, people say it's the best so it's what everyone picks. Myself included.\nSo far, it easily handles everything I throw at it and I have no doubt it'll work well for many years to come. Just make sure to get a good cooling system as this thing runs hot. I use a Noctura NHD-15 and that has worked quite well so far.\nOctober 1st, 2024 Update: So a lot has happened with 13th/14th gen intel processors since I wrote this review and wow... just wow. So I suppose I've been lucky isofar as my own chip has had zero instability issues, backed up by repeated benchmarking, stress, and diagnostic tests from Intel's diagnostic tool, AIDA64 Extreme, and Cinebench.\nI don't currently know if this is because I've been running the chip in its default settings or if I just have a good chip. I was never activated it's \"gaming mode\" through BIOS to fully unlock it due to heat throttling (I have an air-cooled setup). So I'm not 100% certain if I just have a good chip or if it was just saved because I haven't been overclocking it at all.\nI plan to upgrade to a full custom water-cooled loop, so if that ever comes to fruition, I may or may not yet discover if my chip develops any of these issues. If that happens, I'll likely just get a 12900KS. As things stand, my chip is has zero issues so far so I don't need to change my review.",

      "Perfect. Would need much beefier GPU to extract it's full potential.",
      "Can't complain, bought for everyday use, does the job. No overclocking but what can you expect at the price point",
      "Great cpu for what I paid",
      "Can't say it performs well. The only CPUs I can compare it to are a X5680 and an i7 940. It's fine for what I do but not for much else. Barely handles more than 2 cars in BeamNG and struggles in GMOD with a packed(40+)server.",
      "It's a decent 6 core/12 thread CPU. I wouldn't recommend it over the Ryzen 5 5600 or i5-12400F, but it's a solid upgrade over the i5-10400(F) if you're on an LGA1200 motherboard. Should be able to pair with up to an RTX 4060 Ti or RX 6700 XT graphics card without bottlenecking it.",
      "Solid cpu, of course not recommended to buy in 2023 unless you have a lga1200 motherboard already which I did. 6 core, 12 thread cpu. Works with a lot of modern gpus just fine, I got it for €119.",
      "Could be better, not bad though decent price.",
      "Great value 6 core for gaming and work (in Europe at least). Narrowly beats a 1700X in cpu-z and steals the ryzen 5 3600's lunch. Get the non-F version for intel qsv and the extra 2 outputs if it's cheap enough. However, the stock cooler is loud and i have to tinker with the fan curves to make it more silent. Despite this, it's the best CPU i've ever had up to that point, and it's legendary in my book",
      "Great cpu for the price, still holds up in 2023 for value when taking into account it's performance to price ratio, even when it's two generations of Intel cpus old.",
      "cpu. not really worth it in 2023 but for 2022 it was good. 12400 is better now especially with dropped cpu and mobo prices."

      "great budget chip",
      "Cheap and strong quad core. More than enough for Daily tasks.",
      "works. stays cool. fast enough.",
      "The legendary Intel VALUE chip! For the price, can't go wrong with this one.",
      "Affordable and does its job well. The stock cooler’s pushpin mechanism is a bit funky and is kind of loud. Stays at five stars because I bought a CPU, not a CPU cooler.",
      "Cheap seems to work, so far so good.",
      "So far so good for a server CPU. I bought this with power consumption and longevity in mind. I could have gotten away with a 10th Gen, but the 12th Gen should give me a longer life. Has extremely low power consumption at idle, and since this server doesn't turn off, that was a selling point for these California Utility rates. Hard to beat for the low price.",
      "Amazing budget cpu. Cooler keeps it nice at a nice 40c and it doesn't bottleneck a 6700.",
      "Great 4c/8t high IPC CPU for Plex use with Intel quick-sync. I wanted to run emulators as well so I figured it was worth just paying a bit more and going straight to 12th gen. The stock cooler is quite awful though, idling around 50-55c and I took it off and replaced it with a low profile one that fit my HTPC build. The integrated graphics was able to run some PS2 level emulated games, but absolutely choked on Gamecube. I'll get a GPU for that later, but no complaints about it's video capabilities otherwise.",

      "For the price I got it for, $140, it is a decent cpu thats about on par with a 9900k, and will probably have no issues running any game or emulator I need, its kind of hot, but I have a good cooler for it at least.",
      "Pretty good workhorse. Hasn't let me down for the amount of multitasking I throw at it... bit long in the tooth after 2 years though...",
      "What an excellent CPU. I will be sad when I have to move on from it one day. Super easy to cool, has withstood abuse from overclocking. Super snappy and responsive. 3 years later and it shows no signs of slowing down.",
      "Infamously dubbed a \"waste of sand\" by Gamers Nexus, the i7-11700K uses significantly more power than the Ryzen 7 5700X and costs about $100 more brand new, while delivering almost identical performance. It is also beaten in performance by the cheaper i5-12600K, although the latter uses a bit more power. Still, the i7-11700K is reasonably strong and has arguably the best value for a high-end CPU on the LGA1200 socket. It can be worth getting at the right price, which would be no more than $180 secondhand. Due to its high power usage (251W PL2), the i7-11700K requires fairly strong cooling options to unleash its full potential and not thermal throttle.",
      "Decent CPU for what it needs to do, although previous generation CPU's were better. Just got it at an unlucky time when 12th Gen released and 10th Gen was taken out of my nearby Micro Center.\nI have no overheating issues with a 240mm AIO, and it's overclocked to 5.2GHz without touching 70C.",
      "I just changed from i9 to i7 so i can pair the i9 with 3090Ti graphic card.",
      "I love my CPU & it never gets over heated by because it is an Intel CPU it will keep you toasty! After having arthritis spread threw out my body now I am sensitive to the cold which was never an issue for me. Some meds, health problems, etc changed all that so I do not leave my windows open when its freezing outside like I use to. So now it gets warm inside when my PC is going from these 240CFM fans blowing from my i7-11700K Heater. Who needs gas heat or heaters when you got Intel? Any way its a great CPU which I game with & pretty much do anything I need to. I have not had any issues with it at all & am pretty happy with it.",
      "A really good gaming CPU. It works really well for me",
      "Love and very much enjoy this processor.",
      "Performs well. Was originally going to get a 10900K (Alder lake wasn't released yet), but couldn't find any at a good price, so went with the 11700K instead."

      "Really nice CPU for entry-level tasks. It has similar performance to most other 5000-series Ryzen 5 chips. The motherboard I'm using doesn't have display outputs, so I can't say much about the integrated graphics besides the fact that the CPU has it. I'm curious about its overclocking capabilities.",
