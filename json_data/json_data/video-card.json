      "Bought it used and no issues so far.",
      "Much better than I was expecting. It's pretty great for the price, I wish more games supported DLSS and frame gen though",
      "I don't play games. I needed a GPU to speed up photo processing. Topaz AI needs 8 gigs of VRAM. It would not even run on my Windows 12700K without a GPU. With the 4060, I tested the same image that took over 30 minutes to render on a Macbook Pro M2 Pro with 16 GB Ram. On my new Windows build, it took only 12 minutes. It appears the rendering engine runs almost entirely on the GPU. The GPU is pegged at 100%. The CPU is cruising along well under 10%.\nFan runs at 0 rpm until needed and then is still basically silent. GPU only uses 115 watts max.",
      "Great GPU, I know it gets hated on but it's not a bad GPU just a bad price, was luckily able to pick it up as a unwanted gift for 200e, ran great but fans can get a bit loud when under high load",
      "Perfect for my use and 1080p gaming so I can't complain too much, just feels bad that its 8GB for the price.",
      "The MSI Ventus cooler usually gets a bad rep, especially for the higher-end GPUs such as the 80 and 90 class, but I’ve experienced zero issues with this particular model. It’s got great aesthetics, and is well-suited for SFF builds and compact m/ATX cases.\nAt $300 USD, I think the RTX 4060 is a bit too expensive for what it is, given the 128-bit memory bus and 8 GB VRAM. For 1080p and even some games at 1440p, the performance is still pretty good, especially in tandem with DLSS, and it the GPU barely consumes power, so it runs super cool and quiet.",
      "This video card is more than enough for any new video game if you are playing in 1080p and even 1440p. Stop fan mode allows it to be dead silent while idling.",
      "I managed to get this to play 1440p on all of the games I play. I originally thought the 8GB would be a problem, but It's actually just fine!",
      "Does what I expected. great 1080P performances at a reasonable cost. In Canada a RTX 4070 goes for 500 more dollars and depending on your gaming habits the premium can be unjustified.",
      "I’m not one to defend nvidia (lookin at you, 5090 inferno,) but i honestly feel bad for the rtx 4060. At 150 watts of power draw (not even,) it’s extremely efficient. Also, while the generational gains aren’t great, as far as the 40 series lineup goes, it competes against Amd better than the 4070-80-90 do, atleast in my opinion."

      "Probably paid more for this card than I should have, but I didn't want to wait any longer and doubted prices would stabilize any time soon. This thing is beefy 3 slot card with an equally impressive cooler. I never saw my temps rise about 70c and typically only stay around 60c when gaming. A huge improvement over my 3060 ti where the gb of Vram was holding me back at 1440p. The coil whine however was annoying at full loads, however with a -75 undervolt offset, it was hardly noticeable anymore. Love this card",
      "Got 7350 in Steel Nomad after undervolt and overclock. Runs decently cool. Runs almost all of my games at 100+ fps 1440p ultra settings. (Only exception being AoC). Would use again if I had to build a new PC.",
      "FSR4 is amazing compared to FSR3. This heavy GPU comes with a support for holding it, much appreciated from Sapphire. I had the foam padding to prevent the heatsink from bending, no problem to install it. The temperature are very low, great performance. Got lucky to buy it at a decent price.",
      "Cheapest of the 9070 XT variants, good temps after as slight undervolt and overclock. No issues after installation. great performance.\nWaiting for FSR 4 to be utilised on more games",
      "Oh, the unwanted child. I wasn't originally planning on changing GPUs initially, but having seen this at a relatively okay price (and with the looming threat of tariffs jacking its price up), I decided to pull the trigger, even if I was a bit skeptical due to the memory temperature issues noted in a couple reviews. Nope, worked beautifully out of the box, and I'm not expecting much of an issue; I've only had AMD GPUs and none really gave me trouble. Important to note that though later shipments come with foam padding to prevent the heatsink from tilting or bending, mine did not, and yet memory temperatures seem fine as per the readings on HWiNFO.",
      "Bought for a total of $808.55 USD from BitWorks.io, was a lil skeptical but hey its in my hands now.\nNice beefy cooler temps under 50C idle and around 60-65C while in game.\nEssentially just 4080 but red.\nAlso FSR 4 is niceeee.",
      "I managed to get this from Overclockers UK for £650. For a base model, this card is extremely impressive. In Marvel Rivals at 4K, low settings, FSR 4 performance, this card peaked at 3.16 GHz, drawing a maximum of 306 W and averaging 120 FPS over about five hours of playtime according to Adrenaline. VRAM usage also peaked at 13 GB. The core temp hit a peak of 62 C, the memory peaked at 84 C, the hotspot temperature peaked at 81 C, and the fans only ramped up to 33% (1372 RPM).\nThis card runs cool and quiet, though that's not surprising considering the size of it. For a 304 W GPU, I think they might have gone a tad overboard on the cooler. Its size also meant I was just barely able to fit this thing into my Fractal Design Era 2.\nIn terms of software, the Adrenaline app is pretty good, and I prefer it to the NVIDIA app (which itself was a big upgrade over GeForce Experience). It has all the stuff you'd expect, most of which I'll never use, but it makes driver maintenance easy enough to be worth installing.\nIf you're in the market for a 9070 XT, this is a solid option and I can recommend it.",
      "Good card but msrp is dead.",
      "I can not begin to explain how much I love this thing. I will continue to do some more benchmarking on other games just to push it to its limits. Can run anything at 1440p max settings and from what I hear it's really good at 4k aswell. If you can find it anywhere near msrp (or even about $100 more given the current market) GET IT!!!!",
      "amazing max 1440p card"

      "Went on a sale for ~$260 and at that price it's pretty good. I play on 1080P and am able to run The Last of Us Part 1 at ~120 fps with medium/high settings and DLSS. The hottest I've ever seen it get is 65 degrees. I do recommend spending a bit more money to get an AMD card though.",
      "I chose this GPU for my first build, specifically to handle photo editing in Lightroom and Photoshop, as well as some 4K video editing. So far, it’s been a solid performer across the board. With 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, this GPU offers plenty of memory for handling high-resolution images and complex editing tasks without slowing down. In Lightroom and Photoshop, everything runs smoothly—even when working with large files and multiple layers. The GPU acceleration in these programs really benefits from the RTX 3060’s power, making the editing process faster and more efficient. The dual-fan design of the Ventus 2X keeps the card cool under load, and I haven’t noticed any significant noise during operation. It’s a great option if you’re looking for a well-rounded and budget-friendly GPU that can handle creative tasks like photo and video editing without breaking the bank.",
      "i just I recommend a radeon one..",
      "Solid graphics card. Has taken everything I've thrown at it so far and temps run smoothly. Was cheaper than the 8gb version when I ordered everything and so far it's worked well!",
      "Card was smaller than I thought, fit perfectly in my case and its delivering very well, 0 complaints here.",
      "Keeps quite cool, good performance for price.",
      "Bought it with the whole intention of upgrading when the 40 series cards come down in price a bit. Its a solid card for a solid price. Not looked into overclocking cos I don't fancy breaking it. Overall perfect card if you're in the same boat as me and intend to wait for prices to drop. Makes absolutely no noise.",
      "Looks good, decent price, runs quiet, enough for basically all modern titles at 1080p. What more could you ask for?"

The only game I ever play is Grid 2, and I'm getting 4k 60 fps (min) on Ultra and 100 fps (min) on High settings. Paired with a Ryzen 7 9700x, since my usage is really CPU heavy (non-gaming). Other than that, stays cool and quiet for the most part.",

It also gets around 40fps in BeamNG on West Coast map in the Bastion with traffic and around 50 - 55 without traffic (See images for settings) Overall would recommend for budget builds.",

      "I was planning to buy it two weeks ago when the price was £435, but I went on holiday with my family for a week and wouldn’t have been around to collect it. Of course, when I came back, the price had skyrocketed. Luckily, I managed to find one for £480. When I saw the new price, I debated getting the 7700 XT, but I ultimately stuck with the 7800 XT, and I’m glad I did. I’m able to play Oblivion on high settings with ray tracing enabled, at 1440p, and I get around 60 FPS. I’m using an HDMI cable, which isn’t ideal, but it’s what I’ve got for now. Coming from a PS5 and only playing on consoles, it’s a real treat to experience high FPS and beautiful graphics on PC.",

      "Great performance!! gets a little bit loud, but the cooling is great so you can set the fan curve very low. barely reaches over 60°C overall in gaming and the Hotspot stays around 80°C max.",
      "For 500 Bucks you can game every game in 1440p High easily and often even in 4k, great choice! The Cooler makes it good for OC, so make sure to do that for p e r f e c t performance",
      "Just the GOAT for this price range. No questions asked.",
      "Has been amazing, it has a duel bios, with a silent one, and an OC bios. I keep mine on OC because I don't mind noise too much. It is still very quiet with the OC bios.",
      "In my country (The Netherlands) this is pretty much the only card with 16 GB of VRAM for 500 euros or less. I'm happy with it's performance. Out of the box, the fans spin like crazy and makes a lot of noise. I also noticed quite significant coil whine. After undervolting the GPU it is able to run a lot cooler and more efficient without a noticeable decrease in performance, the coil whine also reduced.\nI recommend this product, and recommend buyers to experience with undervolting has it improved my experience with this card a lot.",
      "A little place holder until either a 9070xt or 5080 is bought. It's a good card and performs well at 1440p in the games I play like RDR2, Forza, Hogwarts, Madden 25 & The Witcher 3. the temps are fine at around 60-65c in my setup however the fans can be loud under certain loads. I've set mine under my fan curve software to between 30-60% which is fine. Along with the other cooling within the case, I can get the above temps, and it's virtually silent to quietly running. If you struggle with airflow, this can get loud at +70% fan speed."

Clearly, Nvidia's software devs are preoccupied with AI and enterprise suites to give a damn about consumers and professionals.\nTerrible coil whine, regardless of V-sync settings, which speaks volumes considering the last two gens (4090 & 3090) were fine.

However, I'm not taking chances with this iteration by undervolting and ensuring adequate airflow over the connector.\nManufacturing blemishes on the grills and connector side panel.

      "Waited about a year to upgrade -- read my story above. The price of this thing is too expansive and it's essentially a 4080/ 4080 Super with lower power draw and a little cheaper with more AI capability. It's quiet and it's powerful. I opted to use Nvidia's 12v-2x6 adapter instead of my 12vhpwr adapter due to all the controversy. I don't want to buy ANOTHER PSU. No issues so far. Fingers crossed. With the lack of PhysX support, I had to uninstall 2 metro games and 3 batman games. I don't play them either way.",

      "This was the purchase that triggered the build. I think I bagged the last 9070xt in the UK on launch day!\nGreat GPU, and out of the box it's very quiet. 3D Mark scores are above average for the 9070xt. I ended up underclocking it a bit to save on power. I managed to get a -40mV undervolt combined with a -500MHz underclock and -10% power limit and it runs very cool and quiet, and I'm still getting average 3D mark scores!\nOther 9070xt models can get a better undervolt, I maybe didn't win the silicon lottery, but its still an impressive display for a lower-end 9070xt model.\nNote that this model requires THREE PCIe 8-pin connectors. My PSU had exactly three, but two of the connectors are daisy chained. THIS IS OKAY! I've had zero issues with the daisy chained PCIe connector since installation, and it's been through a lot of stress tests.\nBEWARE GIGABYTE CONTROL CENTER!\nBecause I have a Gigabyte motherboard and a Gigabyte GPU, I downloaded Gigabyte Control Center to control the RGB. This works fine, but one of the other tools (I think maybe the performance tool plugin?) took control of the fan curve, which was ATTROCIOUS. The card's sweet spot for temperature is around 75°C, and at that temperature Gigabyte's default fan curve puts the fans at 100%, which is abour 4000RPM. It's LOUD. Once I uninstalled the fan control tools, the default fan curve is infinitely quieter.\nThe other fan curves for CPU and case fans/pumps are all editable in the BIOS. A bit inconvenient, but the Gigabyte Control Center app doesn't provide any additional functionality.",
      "Got this at launch for Gigabyte's standard price of 730. I'd rather pay MSRP, but we all know that's a thing of the past. At least I didn't have to pay scalper prices.\nMy other PC has a 7900xtx in it and I would say that this GPU keeps up with it well. With ray tracing enabled it seems to do a little better in the games that I play. I personally don't care for ray tracing, but I know that many do. In my ITX case the card runs at 60 under a load with the hot spot just breaking 80.\nAll in all I'm very happy with the performance for the price I paid.",
      "Incredible GPU for 1440p and even 4K gaming. Runs cool, stays quiet, and delivers outstanding performance. Works well with the Ryzen 5 7600, though upgrading to a higher-end CPU would further unleash its full potential.",
      "This thing is pretty sweet. I camped out for the first time in my life on launch day. I got it for MSRP and it's a massive improvement from what I had before. Temps seem reasonable and it looks to be built pretty well too. It is one of the OC variants so I've seen it drawing 350w+."

      "Not the greatest aesthetics, but the cheapest 4060 available and 2x HDMI. Runs quite cool (and silent) in my experience.",
      "The RTX 4060 is a mid-tier GPU. It offers excellent performance for 1080p gaming and respectable results at 1440p, especially in titles with DLSS 3 support.",
      "Solid card for 1080p gaming, 3D Mark scores for 4060 were slightly above average. I take off 1 star because I think it's a bit overpriced for a 1080p card.",
      "Not the best price to performance, but it gets the job done for somebody who wants an Nvidia GPU.",
      "Most YouTubers and online reviewers that I watch/read from say this card is a disappointment for 1080p gamers, but I beg to differ. I am not comparing it against an AMD card because this is my first PC\nI upgraded from a GTX 1660Ti laptop version to this RTX 4060 desktop, and the performance difference is INSANE. I can play Helldivers 2 at 1080p Medium-High Graphic Settings at 120 FPS no issue, Fortnite on DX12 with High settings at 144FPS (without ray-tracing) and 280-300fps on the performance mode. Rocket league is a stable 240 fps at max settings (with a maximum of 300fps from my experience), Minecraft: Java Edition at max240 fps with an avg of 140-180fps with 16 render chunks, with Sodium and all those fabric mods installed, and at around 90-120 fps with shaders at that same render distance.\nAll those FPS listings above was while the card was remaining under an 80C temp. I average about 73-78C on most games. Highest I've gone is 83C on CS2 at around 300 FPS on High settings. I highly recommend this card to any budget builder that can afford this in their budget if possible. I would personally recommend this over the 3060 (8 or 12GB version) because of the lower power consumption while remaining the same performance.\nIf you want a 12 GB card that badly, I recommend looking at GPUs rated for 1440p rather than 1080p. Such as:\nRX 6750XT\nRX 6700XT\nRX 7700XT\nRTX 4070\nRTX 4070 Super",
      "had this running in my self build for one year now and now problems so far.",
      "With the controversy surrounding this card, it performs very well and can give very high frame rates, not to mention it has dlss3 and 3 gen rt cores, it does get a little hot as it hit 69c when running time spy. This is due to the stock fan curve being optimized for acoustics and not performance. But it never gets that hot when playing games or browsing and other stuff like that. Overall this is a good gpu for the price and can run any competitive game at a high frame rate.",
      "Great gpu can run many triple a titles ate 60+ frames with not much frame drop but does come with les vram than the 3060 so kinda of a downgrade but comes with great OC capabilities to be able to compare with many newer gpus on the market",

      "An absolute beast of a card! Chews through everything I have at UWQHD with a steady 100 fps at high settings and 60 at max. This was the cheapest model at the time, and it truly delivers",

      "fantastic card at 1440p great price to performance especially since i dont use blender so i dont really super need an nvidia card and the vram is perfect",
      "GPU sag was the only problem but very easy to fix. Two fan configuration not really ideal but this was the only one at the time. It does its job very well so i would say i’m happy with it. 9/10",
      "Powerful card for the price, I got it for 480 on Amazon. Careful when overclock the vram because it crashes the system. If you starve it for voltage your game will crash. Other than that it had no issue",
      "absurdly good gpu would recommend",
      "If you're not interested in Ray Tracing at it's current state like me, this card is really good value over it's NVIDIA counterparts. There's lots of potential to undervolt and overclock this card, which can put it right up there with the 4070 ti. Having 16 GB of VRAM at this price point is a great bonus too.\nDespite being a 2 fan model, this cooling solution still makes the card run nice and cool.",
      "Big card. strong card. nicely priced card. good card",
      "I was a bit sceptical of the 2 fan cooling system. Turns out it does the job very well, and it's a beast.",
      "Absolute beast of a GPU. Runs every game I throw at it at 100+ fps on max settings at 1080p. Surprisingly quiet for being only a dual fan card and the temps are great as well (never above 40°C.) Video editing performance with DaVinci Resolve is also amazing. The red and black color scheme is very sleek and nice looking. I appreciate it not being insanely long like some other 7800 XT models and also I love the box the card comes in, it just looks so good. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a €500 - €600 GPU and doesn't use Blender (Nvidia absolutely destroys AMD in Blender.)"

      "Most expensive part of the build, but it will probably end up being its Achilles heel down the road. At 1080p this is an absolute beast that will chomp down pretty much anything I throw at it (within reason). However, seeing new games already have the 7700XT below recommended settings worries me for how future proof it'll really be. It somewhat bums me that I had to buy during such a terrible market; I would've appreciated getting a 9070XT or 5060ti instead if either card was reasonably priced. However, for now, it works with everything on 1080p, even heavy ray tracing, so I can't really complain. It's pretty loud, but the cooling is super efficient and I've never seen it go above 60°C. Overclocking speeds are above what's advertised, which is dope.",
      "I'd have given this a 2/5, but I managed to find a solution.\nAt first the factory OC was way too much and ALWAYS crashed in any game. I'd be playing for like 10 minutes and then, without fail, it would freeze and then crash. Very annoying.\nThe solution? Just use Adrenalin to underclock it. My max clock is set at 2395 MHz with 1150 mV.\nAfter that it works AMAZING. I can play most games at max settings in 1080p and basically anything in High 1080p. I'd recommend it more if that first issue wasn't present.",
      "Such a nice looking graphics card, I love the exposed copper piping, LED logo, and just the overall built quality. Great for 1440p",
      "Looks sleek and minimalistic. Performs well at the price point. Cools pretty adequately. It could work spectacularly in 1440p but I've got it for 240hz 1080p gaming and it shreds through loads of games. Very nice.",
      "Better than the 4060ti for around the same price. You really can’t do better than a 7700XT. The Gigabyte Gaming GPU models are my favorite.",
      "Great GPU. The 7700XT is amazing for 1440P gaming able to play most games max settings.",
      "it is amazing and it is so good compared to my old rtx 3050 and the software is amazing",
      "She's a great card! Very cool, and does an awesome job in 1080p. FSR3 makes her even better now! She'll tear Cyberpunk up!",
      "Good build quality card, and it looks very clean. Maybe not the best time to pick up the rx 7700xt considering it's price point compared to last gen cheaper AMD cards, like the RX 6800."

I wanted something that would be suitable to use for 1440p when I upgrade the display, and my hope is that this card will be able to keep up with new releases several years down the line, perhaps using DLSS if necessary.\nIt doesn't come with any kind of anti-sag bracket, so I bought an adjustable pole support on Amazon for $15.",
      "The RTX 4070 is such a great card for 1080p/1440p (and even 4k) gaming. Prices have come down with the 4000 series Super refreshes and I think that makes them even more enticing - especially if you can find them under $550 (which is happening more and more)\nThis Gigabyte card is awesome. I've personally got a Zotac Twin Edge 4070 and the sound profile is a night and day difference. This Gigabyte card is extremely quite even when the fans spin up to 70%. I had to putz around with my Zotac fan curve to never have it spin passed 60% due to how insanely loud those fans get.\nFinally, the cooling solution does work phenomenally well. The card has never exceeded the mid 60s, and it consistently runs about 750 MHz over stock clock speeds (1,920MHz -> 2,668MHz)"

      "A very powerful and sleek card in my opinion.",
      "Get it while it lasts. Seems this model is getting lower and lower on stock since the 50 series releases. I went with the Super instead of Ti Super. The extreme increase in cost didn't make sense to me for the claimed performance. Perhaps if you go for 4k gaming. I like to run at 1440. This for me is perfect price point for monitor/GPU combo for my eyes. You really aren't going to benefit from more pixel unless you get a 40+ inch monitor. 1440 is plenty sharp for my 34\" ultra wide.\nMost games I run hit over 120 FPS.",
      "Great build quality and thermals, stays under 30 on idle and doesn't even crack 50 under load. Smaller than I expected too.",
      "Amazing GPU that absolutely shreds at 1440p with above 120hz framerates in almost every game on ultra settings and runs incredibly cool.",
      "Is expensive but i can play everything i want so w",
      "fans are kind of loud but it is well under load even in itx builds",
      "Good 1440p card, waiting for price drops though from MSRP.",
      "Good cooling and incredible performance for 1080p and 1440p gaming.",
      "Could look a bit nicer but it works amazing!",
      "I've been running this card using DSR 4k and DSDLR 1440P for 2 months now along side a Ryzen 5 7600X and the performance is great for the $600 US price tag. Most of my experience has been in Satisfactory with settings maxed. 4k 70-90 FPS, 1440p 120-150 FPS. Only gripe is the coil whine it generates at times that isn't horrible but its not great. Only really noticeable at low volumes without a headset."

      "This was the most exciting part. My first triple fan card. This was surprisingly light but man was it long (pause). Anyways, it runs cool, isn't too loud IMO and definitely runs any game well (at 1080p that is, honestly overkill on my part but I wanted the futureproof/upgrade + my money hehe). It also fits pretty well in the A3 with an ATX psu (150mm), the slanted cut at the end of the card gives more room for the cables to droop down.",
      "Looks good, runs quiet, and the 7800xt is just a good card in general.",
      "Good job AMD 1440p gaming, 16 gb vram for <500$",
      "I got it during Prime day deals and couldn’t be happier. AMD software is fantastic and getting drivers installed and everything up and running was extremely easy. I haven’t pushed it to the limits yet but so far it’s done everything I wanted it to do without any fan noise or coil wine.",
      "Originally was going to go with a 4070 Super, but this card was significantly cheaper with good specs. I don't use Ray Tracing on the games that I play, so it was an easy choice. This card has no RGB lighting on it, so if you want that, don't get the QICK card - there are other XFX models that have RGB.",
      "This 7800xt is an absolute beast and spits out frames of 144+ at 1440p high settings like its nothing, maxing out my main monitor. AMD software was easy to install and automatically installed the most up to date drivers for me. The card looks great and cooling is great, not sure if its the card itself, the amount of fans I have, or both working together, but temps haven't gone over 60 degrees Celsius after hours of gaming at max load.`",
      "Coming from Intel integrated graphics this thing has blown me away, seems to decimate almost anything you throw at it (almost anything because ray tracing exists, but even then I've been playing Control with ray-traced reflections on and still getting 70-80fps depending on how busy the game is). Runs pretty cool too (60c under load). Very high pitched coil whine though, although this is tolerable with the side panel on."

      "Beside it being hard to get I was quick enough to snatch it for 250$ it runs great",
      "I'm a photo editor, not a gamer. So why pay ridiculous amounts of money on some expensive GPU that won't do a thing to improve the editing workflow? It comes into play for exporting. And the price is unbeatable. ONLY minor bit (for those with glass cases) is the logo light is a very bright white. Would be awesome if somehow it had RGB properties but if that's the only downside, this thing is GREAT.",
      "Intel is doing something right. Card runs very well and cool. No issues with drivers. Great buy considering the crazy market. Surprising thing is it runs better than my old 1080ti @ 1440p.",
      "Well, it’s been a wild couple of months for the GPU market, again. The new generation of cards is being massively gouged, and the old generation is shooting up in price. So, how does my latest acquisition hold up? Pretty well, to put it plainly. My B580 was on backorder since the end of 2024, and I had it in hand a month later for Intel’s suggested retail price. I’ve always liked slightly odd peripherals, and Intel’s previous forays into the GPU market have certainly been awkward.\nOn the hardware side, it ticks all the boxes for decent longevity. The industrial design of the shell is perennial—a black plastic rectangle bereft of aggressive angular lines, rainbow LEDs, or the military foot-locker aesthetic board partners seem to love. The specs are great for the price—trading blows with the 4060 Ti and 7600 XT. Best of all, the thermals and potential for overclocking have been solid.\nIntel’s software is Radeon-tier, in my opinion. A little better organized than AMD’s offerings, but with fewer features. Some options aren’t explained clearly, and the ability to reduce the card’s voltage below stock settings just doesn’t exist. A lot of third-party tuning software (such as Afterburner) also struggles with Intel’s architecture.\n“Radeon-like” sums up much of the Battlemage experience, as there’s significant overlap between the brands. Vulkan support isn’t just optional for this card—it’s preferable. Linux support shouldn’t be a matter of if but when. And unless XeSS catches on in more games, FSR 3.1 is the best way to upscale most titles.\nWith Intel’s limited track record in the dedicated graphics business, it’s hard to say exactly how well this card will age. But I think it’s a great deal for the tumultuous present.",
      "Found this slightly below MSRP at Yongsan.\nLove the design, although I prefer the Alchemist LE design. Great temps even in an SFF case.\nGetting about 2 black-screen flickers each day, but that might be because of the use of a PCI-E riser cable. I've reseated it today. Let's see how it goes.\nPerformance is as expected from the reviews. About on par with my 3060 Ti.\nThere seems to be a bug either with Discord or the driver where the GPU cores are used for encoding Discord stream instead of the encoder and it kills the performance (CS2 framerate more than halving, for example), but as an ex-A750 owner, I went in expecting bugs so I'm not too disappointed. OBS performance seems about the same as 3060 Ti.",
      "hey at this price, 12g vRAM, decent performance and solid build and looks ill take it. beats giving Nvidia a kidney to play forntnite with my kids.",
      "Best price to performance gpu. Linux drivers arent there yet so I would recommend going for Windows",
      "great CPU. This was my first build, so cant compare to others, but with a 14600KF flight simulator 2024 runs nicely at 1440p on high setting. Great value for money at 300 eur",
      "It runs 1080p high or ultra 60+ fps on almost every game I tested"

      "you can get better options for the price point, but i have no issues with it as of yet.",
      "Due to freezes from what seems like driver conflicts in Linux between AMD and NVIDIA, I had to switch out my secondary GPU from a 6600XT to a used 3060 12GB. Fine card, the VRAM might be useful for a relatively low price.",
      "found it used seller sold it broken i fixed it and it has been good ever scince",
      "This is a very capable GPU, it runs cool and quiet and keeps up with any game I throw at it. I'm expecting it will work just great with the soon to be released Cities Skylines 2.",
      "Not much to say about this card except it came in right in the middle of the price point for a performance card these days. Yes, it's on the lower end of the spectrum, however, it (again) does exactly what I want/need it to do and more. I am on more of a power budget at the moment (650w) so a i9 13th gen and a 40 series RTX is out of the question (not to mention out of my price range. I won't pay Jenson and the Leather Jacket Mafia extortion fee's for \"gaming\" video cards) so this card @ the $429.99 I paid for it is PERFECT. The prices on these cards is actually quite volatile at the time of this writing, and brand new one could cost anywhere between $430-$500USD. The only complaint I have is anything by ASUS is apt to want some sort of rootkit software to utilize their BS RGB. The way around that is: Install the software, set your RGB, and brute uninstall it and wipe anything with the name ASUS in it from the hard drive. This is probably overkill, but hey...I cannot stand their software."

      "Absolutely brilliant, a gigantic upgrade from my previous gtx 1650, firmly team Red going forward",
      "XT premium was over $100 extra, not worth it, and this one fit the aesthetic. Runs very cool, base clocks and wattage kept it high of 55'C under Port Royal 30 minute loop and max TDP of 245W. It had transient spikes up to 445W. Manageable and quite card. The RGB light strip is programmable with Sapphire's TRIXX software and can be read by external device such as an RGB remote. The only weak part is the GPU support bracket feels flimsier than an adjustable GPU stand. Overall great card and performs rasterization wise exactly like a 7900 XT but with better ray tracing and streaming and FSR4 support. Also 2x8pin connectors so no melting cable issues is nice.",
      "Best good looking RX 9070 XT in my opinion and has overclocking features that could beat the RTX 5070 TI or 5080 on some games. It has excellent air cooling with triple fans design and in my experience I have never reach above 65 degrees C with this on my games."

      "Love it, especially for the price! Great for designing and editing videos.",
      "Sue me, but I'm happy with the 4060. Performs killer on high settings in 1080p. IMO, best value at the price point. I was not comfortable spending over $100 extra for slightly better performance (I bought this at $300), but I was willing to pay the $30 extra over the RX 7600 for the ray tracing performance, which I thought the slight bump in performance was worth the slight bump in cost.",
      "Better cards at this price for sure.",
      "I really don't get the hate with the 4060. Yes I couldve gone for better options 100%, but it still holds out well with whatever games I play like roblox, GTA, Red dead 2, Forza, whatever. It's not like it explodes when I use any of them.",
      "Its a good card, just theres better options out there at this price point (RX 7600) got this for £250, could have been better but people love to see \"Nvidia\" and \"RTX\"",
      "I spent a lot of time considering different GPUs, but I'm still not that happy about choosing the 4060. It seems like every GPU that's better costs an extra $200 at the minimum - and that's just for GPUs that are marginally better. Other GPUs at the same price range were worse though, so maybe I got good value?",
      "Love this card, use it on the quiet BIOS and it's dead silent. If this was my main gaming GPU I'd probably be a little underwhelmed but for media encoding / decoding, AI work etc. it's a great little budget option.",
      "The GPU workload on this machine is minimal given the use case, so I kept this modest. It's still doing everything I need it to do. I did notice when I upgraded Photoshop from v25.7 to v25.9, the GPU relevant Pugetbench score in photoshop (Filter Score) jumped from 88 to 100, so it's clearly doing something for us."

      "A beast. Comes with anti-sag bar. Runs cool at 70 Celsius under load, 80-85 Celsius hotspot. Runs quiet and i haven't heard any coil whine yet",

      "A unit of a GPU, 300 ish fps in seige on 1440p ultra",
      "This is an excellent card. It runs ultrawide 3440x1440 high settings without breaking a sweat. The fans are loud above 50%, but in a good case it runs at 65C with the fans at 30% and is nice and quiet. It is one of the longest cards on the market, so make sure your case has room.",
      "What a beast. Not much more to say. Runs all my games at 1440p max settings (no ray tracing) at 144fps or more. highest temps ive seen so far are 57C on the gpu and 83 hotspot. Fans can get a little noisy but with a custom fan curve its barely noticable. Looks great too in a more minimal build.",
      "It's a fantastic GPU. To put this into perspective for you, the last graphics card I ever actually saw and touched with my own eyes and hands was when I was in middle school and my dad bought a GeForce 6600 GT in 2004. Now, if you don't know what a gpu from 2004 looks and feels like, google that and then compare it to this.\nIt's like watching an M1 Abrams roll up on Godzilla.\nThe thing weighs a ton. I'm pretty sure that besides the case and PSU, it's the heaviest piece of equipment I bought for the entire build. This isn't a negative thing for me though. I like the bulk. I like the design. I like the lit up XFX on the side. It came with a Z-bar for support, and it is needed. Once installed there is no give on the card, it feels very supported. My only gripe is the little silver bracket that's included for the Z-bar installation has a very weak adhesive on it. It liked to slide while I was trying to screw in the 4 support screws, so I had to continually remove the card to readjust the bracket. A nice pain in the ***, but overall it doesn't effect the quality of the card.\nIt runs everything I want flawlessly, doesn't get too hot, and I don't hear any whine or odd sounds from it. I'm very happy with the purchase and I will be buying XFX products again.\nedit: spelling"

      "I really prefer the Nitro+ over all other version of the 7900 XTX. It looks great and performs unbeleiveable good in cooling and overclocking. Unfortunally i put it under water... In the beginning the build was planned with an alphacool core waterblock but unfortunenatly its EOL. So i had to switch to a bykski one. First i was a little suspicious of them but the block turns out to be very well made and its performing very good. I put an Hineywell ptm on the die and pink thermal putty on evrything else. It runs at 3180Mhz with 2800Mhz on the memory.\nAnd then i flashed the Asrock aqua OC bios on the card, which made it possible to install an Asrock program to make it an extrem OC bios. This took the power limit from 460W to 560W. Big jump. That was the last step i needed to get to No. 1 in Time Spy Extreme, Speedway and Port Royal in Germany and top 10 global. Only downside is that the first HDMI port is not working anymore because the Asrock Aqua has a Displayport at that spot.",
      "Love/hate relationship with Relive, but I still use for ease of use when taking screenshots/clips. Still have some driver crashes occasionally. Also runs kinda hot (even in old build). Have some new pads and PTM7950 to apply, but haven't gotten around to doing yet.",
      "It's my first AMD card and I didn't want to spend €2000 on the graphics card alone, so I opted for the 7900 XTX.\nSo far I haven't noticed anything negative except for the LED bar, which flickers if you don't check \"use external control\" in the Trixx software.\nProbably fixable by AMD adjusting the driver, but I'm not sure.",
      "It's a been a long while since I have used an AMD card. I am very happy with this card for what it is. I am also very impressed with Sapphire as an AIB. The ARGB port is a brilliant way to ensure compatibility with other software vendors rgb implementations without introducing any additional overhead from plugins/additional applications. The fan header is cool, though I preferred to use my motherboards fan header so I could control the curve with fan control I also love the look of this card. My only gripe is that its not quite powerful another to drive my 57\" G9. I have to scale back setting and crank up FSR quite a bit to get decent framerate. However, I assumed this going and will address with a 5090 when they are readily available. Not a fault of this card, and I think you can get a great experience on a 4k display.",
      "Value 10/10 Looks 10/10 Temps ~70C under load Fan noise 6/10\nEven at full price the card is a good deal compared to the rtx 5070 given that there is no change to get those at msrp.\nThe card looks amazing and has a really sturdy high quality feel. They dont skimp on material - the metal sheet around is about half a centimeter thick steel, the plastic bit on the light bar is thick. The light bar is bright and has all the color options you could want.\nTemps stay reasonable and well under max range when under extended medium-high loads. It uses 3 8 pin power connectors, to avoid hotspots at the cable connections its best to use good cables/extensions and make sure the PSU has the slots.\nThe max noise on all of the fans on my build are under 35 db, I don't know why I bothered because the card itself produces about 56 db at 75% fan speed, which is well audible if the pc sits on the desk.",
      "An absolute beast of a card in the benchmarks I've run. Couldn't be happier with upgrading to this from my 2060 Super.",
      "What an amazing job AMD did with this card, only to be topped by Sapphire’s incredible cooling solution. I used the Adrenaline software to lockthe clock to minimum 2500Mhz and maximum 2600Mhz, while giving +15% power limit and undervolting it to 1120mV. This ensures stable, high performance because it’s not spiking to reach a very high clock and then dropping because of thermal throttle, while also shredding the wattage from 400-450w in games to 250-280w. For reference, in Division 2 (my main game), I pull 350 FPS in Countdown, with the temps being 55-58c, consuming 250-280w, with the fan being inaudible at 700-900RPM.\nTruly a remarkable piece of engineering.",
      "Ended up opting for the NITRO+ after trying the Asrock Phantom Gaming and Sapphire Pulse. The Asrock got returned after reading many reviews abotu eventual thermal issues. The Pulse got returned when the NITRO+ price dropped to the same amount. Love this card. Its beefy, quiet, and cool. Best 7900 XTX out there not on water.",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE this GPU!!! I get over 100 fps 4k gaming in Tarkov on medium like settings!",
      "Runs surprisingly quiet under load and runs anything I want at max settings without problems. It even allows me to run without FSR frame generation or upscaling. Driver compatibility for Linux is unbeaten atm for AMD, so this card was a no brainer. Also one of the best looking GPUs I’ve seen out there. Also clocks really high with not much of an overclock. A beast of a GPU"

      "It looks smaller on the picture than it actually is in reality - it's a hefty boi! Fits perfectly well in a Fractal Terra, carries any game I throw at it in 1440p at Ultra-mega-super-duper settings. Yeah, it doesn't handle ray tracing all that well - but it's not like it can't at all. Ultra Cyberpunk with Ultra raytracing still runs at 80fps in the city, or 130-140 without. I'm not too bothered about it, so there's that. Runs cool, runs well - what else can we possibly want?",
      "Got this on launch day at MSRP. Performs better than I expected, and runs near silent even at heavy utilization running 4K on ultra settings.\nAt under 290mm this is one of very few 9070s out there for SFF builds. The A4-H2O can technically accommodate a 320mm card but with the pump placement of the Pure Loop 2 fx, the shorter card allows for some extra space at the front of the case for routing the AIO pipes.",
      "So far it's the only dual fan and the shortest card for the 9070. Had no issues with it other than memory temp. GPU temp is around 55celsius, memory temp gets a bit high at around 85c on full load. As far as i know high memory temp is normal for the 9070 series. If it worries you for longevity you might want to increase the fan speed. Which is something i might do aswell.\nI was able to get it at the dutch msrp, currently the card is 100euro's more expensive than msrp. I'd say it's a good buy at msrp any higher is really up to you to decide.\nHad a RX 6600 before, all i can say it is a very big performance difference.",
      "Got it at MSRP price and, for that price, it is a bargain. Unfortunately scalpers are scalping now. Huge performance increase over my 3070 (which now lives in my other half deskop for 3D modeling), absolute silence, low temps and will not require to change my PSU.\nThe compact form factor is also very nice to have in the case to improve airflow\nAMD, just release the ROCm update now! :) my toying with ollama is now suspended.

      "Wasn’t fussed what 9070xt I got, as long as it wasn’t more than $1139 which was the lowest they could be had for here. Any higher and I couldn’t justify it, especially with the 9070 being a good option.\nNot a fan of the rgb so I am grateful of the switch on the side.\nNoise and thermals have been great so far.",
      "Good card. Mine didn't undervolt too well but thermals and noise are acceptable stock and even better after a lower power limit. I honestly don't like the fan shroud aesthetics but I love the backplate design. The RGB fans look a little tacky but when mounted horizontally the lighting it provides to the case makes up for it. If this was a plain, no-frills card it would be perfectly average but the white and RGB coloring is a nice addition for people who want that look.",
      "Great card if you get it for MSRP. First, I was disappointed by a coil wine but after changing a psu it is barely noticeable now.",
      "Managed to nab at listing price ($670).\nVery impressive so far, though my Linux drivers (kernel: 6.13.7-200.nobara.fc41.x86_64) are apparently a little out-dated? I noticed some really strange display glitching (with color accuracy: prefer accuracy) and VRAM allocation catastrophes in some games (MHWilds). 16GB is weirdly not enough for 4K games. Also no go-live ROCM support, very unfortunate but not surprising :(\nMy take is that, for <=$700, this is the best value card on the market, regardless of what people say. But it's not we-want-40%-market-share good unless you can get one at $600. +Linux support on release is honestly impressive but it's not enough, yet. Adrenalin pleaseee, I can't even toggle FSR4 because of it."

      "Had quite the experience getting this card, but managed to miraculously get this at MSRP during the pandemic in 2021. 3 years later, (2024), it's still going strong, and honestly I don't see myself upgrading until at least next year (late 2025). It's a founders card, so it looks good but you don't get as many quirks to it. Never overclocked it and don't plan to since I'm too scared to.",
      "Overkill honestly for 1080p gaming but I use it at 1440p and it manages to do fine in most games but certain ones use all the VRAM.\nIt is still incredibly fast though and would highly recommend buying this one used instead of buying a new 4060 ti.",

I play old RTS games like the Total War Series, and this card runs everything I want at ultra settings with no issue. Playing WH3 I get an avg of 93FPS at ultra settings. Temps never climb above 68C. The FE architecture is sleek. Going to keep this card for a long time.",

      "I was not planning to upgrade my 4090 to a 5090 but I saw at a local MicroCenter that there were 5090s in stock. So, I kind of YOLO'd and got one. So far no issues with any melting cables or driver issues. I plan to upgrade my monitor/TV to a higher refresh rate than 4k at 120Hz to take more advantage of the 5090. Boy are these GPUs getting pricey, I can only imagine what a 6090 will cost.",
      "Awesome GPU. Got lucky and was able to get it through Best Buy. Was happy GPU had all its ROPs and so far haven't had any problems with the cable. May do a slight under volt on it to be safe.",
      "Very fast GPU\nThe fastest GPU money can buy, what else is there to say?\nDesign-wise, any third-party design is a great choice, save some money and get something like this instead of an Astral or Suprim... temps are incredible and there is plenty of OC headroom.\nAnd if you can wait then wait, do not convince yourself to drop 50% over MSRP like I did just to get it sooner!",
      "It's surprisingly light for its weight. And it comes with a really cheap anti-sag support thing that I don't really like much. But I got a decent bin, and the cooler sure pulls its weight nicely!",
      "Right now, no problems. Lets hope it stays that way so i can play with it for years to come :)"

      "I think at the <$300 USD price point, the 6700XT is an ideal GPU for 1080p and 1440p gaming. The 12 GB VRAM should help the card age remarkably better than some of the competing 8 GB cards in its relative price range.\nThis XFX card in particular is real nice; the cooler relatively runs cool and quiet, with a sleek aesthetic that will fit most builds. For any prospective buyers looking for a used GPU, this particular model has my seal of approval.",
      "Runs a little hot and gets a little loud when the fans are at full rpm, but I have not been able to find a game yet that it cant run at at least medium-high settings at 90+ fps.",
      "Stays remarkably cool in a cramped case. Stays under 70°C under prolonged load despite being directly next to the power supply in this build.",

AKA look at the specs of games and run for the stuff that works not for the stuff that boasts, it's just overkill sometimes lol",
      "I wanted a big gpu, and this definitely delivers on that end. Preforms super well for the price, though I have noticed that it likes to stutter on certain games, namely assetto corsa.",
      "This card is a BEAST running all my games on ultra 1080p\nNo problems so far\nWill update if there is any",

      "It looks and performs really well. Temps stay around 42 while gaming on 1080p. I prefer single-player games like Doom, Cyberpunk 2077, Deus Ex, etc. This GPU hasn't disappointed me yet. I'd call it a \"Hidden gem\"."

      "I know people come for the 4060 Ti and the 4060 range of graphics cards in general, and I understand why. I agree that the prices at release were absolutely not worth it for price to performance ratio. However, I went with this card more recently because when I was looking, it was at the right price point for what I could afford at the time and accomplished what I needed it to (I was previously using a 6GB 1660 Super that was loaned to me as a temporary placeholder, so this is a big upgrade).\nMy games are running at really decent frame rates, the graphics look good, it's not a power guzzler, and while it's not a heavy-hitter like the 4070 and other models, it's still a big performance boost from what I was used to. It also did this at a price point that didn't cripple my bank account for the foreseeable. If you can afford a better card, go for that, but if you have a budget, this is a solid card that won't put you in debt for the next year.",

      "This is an incredible GPU. Solid construction, metal blackplate, visually attractive, stylish, 24 GB VRAM. Easily does 60 FPS 4K in highly demanding rasterized games and well over 120 FPS 5K in less demanding rasterized games. The biggest surprise to me is the ray tracing performance. Although I'm personally not a fan of ray-tracing, in the few games I have where it's available such as Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, I'm able to achieve 60 FPS at 4K with full ray-tracing capabilities and without using any upscaling at all. Let me get back to you after I download and run the Half-Life RTX conversion or Cyberpunk 2077, but the ray-tracing performance thus far is quite capable and nowhere near as deficient as reviews have led me to believe that it would be.\nI also have to say that I really like the Radeon Adrenalin software suite and how well FreeSync works. The smoothness in my games now is incredible.",

      "Beast at gaming!! I love this card because there is no Nvidia tax and it literally have 24 GB which Nvidia cant even offer for their 5080",
      "Best GPU in the market for price. 4090 for almost $2,000 isn't worth the performance, FSR 3.0 and the infinity fabric cache shared between qualifying Ryzen CPU's makes this thing the best GPU to ever hit the market Imo",
      "Big, large, and chonky. It's a killer for 4K. All my homies don't care about Ray Tracing and DLSS. This might be the last \"high-end\" card we see from AMD for awhile.",
      "Love this card!\nThe finals around 150fps Warzone 250fps So more than enough for me.\nPainted it white to match my setup, turned out awesome.",
      "A great alternative to the 4080S if you don't want to pay the Nvidia tax or get caught up in the AMD vs Nvidia fanboy wars (at the end of the day, they're both great GPUs and can't go wrong with either one, I personally don't care for RT). Electricity is affordable where I live so not entirely concerned with the power draw."

      "Really good budget gpu for the price. The only thing about the asrock challenger variant is the led strip isn't aRGB or even RGB. Instead, it's just GB, as in, green and blue. Still looking into if it can actually be controlled, but so far nothing. Other than that it preforms great, and I can barely hear the fans. For intel arc in general, something is bugged out in the intel graphics software, and so every time I re-boot my system, it resets the gpu fan curve to the default (not horrible, but not ideal)",
      "Hands down the best gpu for the 300$ price bracket. I haven't run into any issue with the drivers all of my games and software have runned flawlessly. The max temperature i saw was 61 and at idle it stays around 40. No coil wine."

      "I've got to say I am very impressed with this card. It gets a lot of flak from rich youtubers and reviewers online, but its a solid card. I play primarily AAA titles, old and new. I'm not much of an E sport gamer so I don't care all that much about fps. This card is able to play games like RDR2, the Tomb Raider reboots, and TLOU1 at 1440P max settings with 60FPS. For the very demanding games like TLOU1 you do need frame gen to keep that 60FPS stable but for everything else I mentioned and games similar to it, it chews through them at native 1440 just fine. I did notice some FPS fluctuation in Tomb Raider 2013, but its most likely due to that games PC port not being all that optimized being over a decade old. The big kicker on this card is the large 16GB memory buffer, it severely helps at 1440P and is the reason why its even able to game at that higher resolution. Despite what folks say, its not useless. Its got about a 288GB memory bandwidth which is on the higher side for the 128 bit bus and is more than adequate for 1440P gaming. Again, I see no issues and got the card for a bit more than an RTX 4060 and I'm loving it. Temps are good, the fans nice and quiet, the card has good thermals, and it's just about 2 slots so it fits perfectly into my SFF console sized case. At MSRP for 30 bucks more than an NVIDIA 4060 the card is incredible value and its awesome that you can get into high fidelity 1440P gaming for sub 350 bucks",
      "Excellent for 1080p but struggles a bit on 1440p. Otherwise pretty cheap for a 16gb gpu."

      "A solid performing GPU with a solid performing cooler, 67 degrees under load (tested with msi kombuster) really glad I bought it when I did because the price I paid over a year ago is still a better value than today's GPU pricing.",
      "This thing is a monster, but is also MASSIVE, it does come with a support bracket to help reduce sag, but make sure you put that in last, otherwise you will just be taking it out in order to reach sockets anyways. All in All this thing just eats up any game that isn't completely reliant on ray tracing. The whole Red team Green Team stuff is old, but if you don't want to pay the green tax this card will do what you want it to.",
      "The reason for the upgrade. This thing is also a beast. I game at 4k 60hz and the cpu/gpu combo handles everything at the highest settings. Coming from a 6650xt this was a night and day difference. Ray tracing isn't that important to me so I can't justify the nvidia premium. I bought this Jan. 20ish for $640 at newegg, at the time 9070tiS was $850. No brainer of a decision and after a few weeks and seeing what has happened to prices, glad I stuck with Team Red",
      "Grabbed this for $650 and I'm not looking back. It seems like it can handle whatever I throw at it (3440x1440, 120hz monitor) and even a bit of RT if I want to try that out.",
      "I was lucky to snag this one before the price shot up in Feb 2025.\nI can't say I've really put it through it's paces, but performance seems good so far.\nWhen I picked it up, I understood it wasn't great at ray-tracing. I mainly care about resolution and frame-rate, and don't mind bumping the settings down in most games. It seemed like this would be a great card for raster gaming in 4k and so far that's been the case.\nBut... I've been playing Cyberpunk, and couldn't resist seeing how it would handle a ray tracing workload. 4k ulta, no ray-tracing runs at 120 FPS without a hitch. With the lightest rtx settings the performance drops to ~60 FPS, even at 1440. 60 is definitely playable in most situations, but I have a VA monitor and anything under 100 gets awfully smeary.\nIt does what I wanted it to do well. It's a bit frustrating that ray tracing is beyond the 7900's reach, but I don't think there's a card on the market for under 1000 USD that would do better (this card may cost more than that now). I know I made some other choices (like a 4k VA monitor) which also make the ray-tracing dream harder to realize. At the same time I have to admit I'm a bit bummed. I'm not getting the \"real\" shadows and seeing reflections. I want it all, I just don't want to spend double the rest of my components to get it. It's not really this card's fault--The NVIDIA marketing machine worked. I'm tempted to drop more than a few month's rent on some silicon that will be obsolete in a few years just so some grass has a shadow in a part of the screen I'm barely looking at",
      "For $585, ya just aint beatin it. Absolutely not possible. It's an S tier card at this price point and the only \"bad\" thing about it is coil whine when you're pushing 2000+fps. This only happens in Minecraft and Roblox. I feel like most people with a high end rig don't even touch those games (maybe MC with shaders) so it's not really applicable. After switching from NVIDIA, I'm always getting an AMD GPU now. Super impressed.",
      "Absolute beast. I can’t afford a 4k monitor so this is the perfect card for 2k. It just runs through every game I play in max setting. I have not undervolted it or anything, just use it as it. Without RT, Spiderman MM, Hitman 3, GTA V, goes at 100-120 fps; With RT, 60-80 fps (GTA V even have stutters, so I just lower the setting to High). Temp is good, around 65C at 99% utilization for 2-3 hours of gaming. Noise is also minimal, I can’t hear any noise comparing to the CPU and case fans. I guess Sapphire does make good graphic card. I chose them over Powercolor and Gigabyte cards, which were 20-30 dollar cheaper.",
      "Crazy performance for $600 but I hate the red on it just personal preference",
      "Very quiet, and easy to install EXCEPT the bracket that comes with it. Even when working it seems very quiet.\nI'm not going to dock a star for the bracket because, again, I think it's just user error. It took me probably half an hour to get the bracket on and it was very annoying.",
      "The Sapphire PULSE 7900 XT OC performs beyond what I expected since I came from being an RTX 3060 laptop user. Also, I was interested in overclocking, so I went to Adrenalin and tuned several settings:\n[Fan Tuning]:\nZero RPM: Disabled\nAdvanced Control: Enabled\n[GPU Tuning]:\nAdvanced Control: Enabled\nMin Frequency: 500\nMax Frequency: 3100\nVoltage: 990\n[Power Tuning]:\nPower Limit: 15%\n[VRAM Tuning]:\nMemory Timing: Fast Timing\nAdvanced Control: Enabled\nMax Frequency: 2568\nAfter months of constant playing (1440p & 240Hz), I haven’t faced any huge issues, and the 7900 XT has been working great and better after tuning. I optimized the GPU fans to be at 65% RPM when the GPU hotspot temperature reached 75 Celsius to ease the heat and noise level. I never saw the temperature go beyond 80, usually around 75 Celsius at best. So, most of the time, the 7900 XT stays silent and doesn’t consume much power, although it does get somewhat loud and power-hungry (100% ~ 365 watts) on GPU-heavy games (7DTD and Space Marine 2.) The 7900 XT did create coil whines at first, but over time, it disappeared. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with my purchase."

      "great card, runs 1440p on high settings and 20 VRAM is great future proofing",
      "Got this card for $700 at Microcenter, and at that price the 7900XT is a pretty decent buy for the performance. However, there definitely are a few issues I have with card, starting with a reference model specific issue regarding memory junction temperatures; If the GPU core temperature is 60C, the memory junction temp is usually at 84C, which is a 24C delta between the two. This drastic difference in temperature seems to be a flaw with the reference designs only, and so should be solved with AIB models.\nAlthough the total board power was 315W max as expected, I found that the card also tried to boost all the way to 2900MHz, which is 500MHz past the advertised boost clock! Under this behavior the \"GPU power maximum\" reading in HWinfo64 could reach all the way to 500W, which was just unsettling. What compounds this issue is the fact that the card has very bad coil whine when it tries to boost to such high clocks. And so to optimize the card I simply limited the clock to 2400MHz, increased the memory clock to 2714MHz, increased the power limit to +15%, and undervolted it to 1030mV. With these settings, I only lost 5% of the stock performance while consuming a lot less power on average (315W down to sub-250W) and greatly silenced the coil whine. If the card shipped like this at stock I would have probably given it 5 stars with the only caveat being the high but not dangerous memory junction temperatures."

      "Performance uplift compared to the 4080S is unfortunately pretty sad. Still performs great and is even better with some oc and power limiting. 24gb vram would have been the right thing, but that'll probably be the super then.\nThermals and noise are fine. A 2.5 or 3 slot cooler with this design would have been absolutely amazing.\nStill looks great, 4000 super design was a bit better though.",
      "Grabbed this by pure luck from Best Buy on launch day! Noticeable coil whine when under load. As far as I can tell this is just how it goes with the 4000 series and newer higher-tier cards in the Nvidia stack. I used three different models of 7900 XTX prior to this with a much higher power draw and did not experience coil whine. Not a huge drawback but definitely worth noting.",
      "Small amount of coil-whine under full load, not crazy but could it was present if you were paying attention. Was lucky enough to get one launch day at best buy. Its ridiculous to spend more than MSRP on this card though.\nJust got finished overclocking the card to see what it is capable of and its at 100% stability with the core clock at +375 MHZ, yielding about and extra 5-8% FPS. Even finished a speedway run at +450 MHZ but was far from stable at that range. Temps at +375 MHZ were peaking at 70C so (and I'm new to overclocking so not sure about this) but it seems the limiting factor is probably voltage or power delivery. Didn't want to raise those though; I'm not confident enough for that yet.\nPlanning on undervolting and overclocking for everyday use now."

      "For the GPU, I chose the RTX 9070XT OC TUF, which I have so far been very pleased with. As mentioned earlier, my old PC had the 3080 OC, which I was also very happy with, and I was actually considering getting a 5080, but after NVIDIA's embarrassing launch of their new GPUs, I decided to go with AMD. Unlike NVIDIA, AMD didn't lie about the performance, which is a significant plus. While gaming and running benchmarks, the performance and temperatures of the card have been excellent .",
      "Best graphics card I've ever had. The pure rasterization is fantastic and can run any game or render any 3d model.",
      "I was expecting to get a 5090 FE, but increasingly that became a pipedream. Upgraded to Team Red this time around. Performs great, albeit a bit power hungry but stays exceptionally cool.\nI still play on 1440p so this thing absolutely shreds as needed. The upgrade alone from 10GB to 16GB VRAM has been amazing.",
      "I really cannot compare this to other 9070 XTs. After a few NVidias I had forgotten coil whine, and now it is back just like on my 1950 XTX years ago. But now I am too tired to care too much, I use headphones anyway."

      "This card is one of the few 9070 XTs advertised as reaching 3100 rather than 3060 MHz boost clocks, alongside the ASRock Taichi and some XFX cards. Interestingly, the Aorus and Taichi are also the cheapest 9070 XT flagship cards. With out of the box settings it actually boosted to 3150 MHz. This card has a vapour chamber, dual bios, and uses 3x8pin, so on paper the only downside is that it doesn't use PTM7950.\nCooling is excellent as would be expected from the massive heatsink, and the default fan curve prioritizes lower fan speed over lower temps, with fans not even beginning to spin until the hotspot reaches 50 degrees, and usually spinning at around 1000 rpm (max ~3500) unless temps heavily increase. With a relatively quiet fan curve hot spot temp remains below 65 degrees and VRAM below 75. Running fans at max speed without sharply increasing case fan speeds during benchmarks with overclocked VRAM, speeds over 3300 MHz and +10% power limit the highest temperatures I noticed were 78 degrees on the hot spot and 86 degrees on the VRAM. More than adequate performance given the task and well below thermal limits.\nSpeculative, but I also suspect that these cards are very aggressively binned, moreso than any other 9070 XT model. At first I noticed that my card was an absolute silicon lottery win, reaching #3 Port Royal, #5 Steel Nomad DX12, and #9 Time Spy Graphics Score on the 3DMark 9070 XT leaderboards. A friend with another Aorus 9070 XT also got relatively high scores, and I saw another example online. I checked the 3DMark leaderboards again and noticed that 5 of the top 10 Time Spy graphics scores were Gigabyte cards, 5 of the top 10 Port Royal scores were Gigabyte cards, and 6 out of the top 10 Steel Nomad scores were Gigabyte cards. With Gigabyte being a second tier AMD AIB, the overrepresentation in benchmark scores, the Aorus being one of the few 3100 MHz cards, and that Gigabyte Gaming OCs seem much more common than Gigabyte Aorus cards, I think it's very possible that Gigabyte is aggressively binning both the GPU chips and VRAM that goes into their Aorus cards.\nGot this for $1020 CAD ($710 USD) when \"MSRP\" models were selling for around $950 CAD. Unless it was confirmed Aorus 9070 XTs are all aggressively binned I would not rate 5 stars if pricing improved on other 9070 XT models, 5070 Tis, or price went up on this card."

      "Nice Budget Card. Got it used, purrs like a kitten and runs Helldivers 2 and Deep Rock Galactic pretty well :3",
      "Great price to performance. Really good for entry-level budget systems, and achieves great FPS in multiple games tested upon.",
      "One of the best budget gpu's at this time run's every \"popular\" game great and it can achieve a pretty 70 to 60 fps in more demanding games at medium to high settings (or more if you enable fsr and frame generation). I also spray painted this one white to match the build so yeah it's a good card.",
      "By default runs fan speeds way too high for idling (2000rpm < idle) in my opinion, and the AMD software sets it to default every time the computer gets completely powered off. Runs games well at medium settings 1920x1080 usually 100 fps or more. The gpu itself is great but the software could be better.",
      "really good cooling, very quiet, almost always at zero rpm, and the fans are really quiet even when they run. the temps are really good, this idles at 38 c, and the highest it's gone was 64 c, and that was for a very brief moment. i dont know what they talk about when they say driver issues, i havent encountered a single issue with the drivers. i would recommend this, the gigabyte model, and the sapphire model.",
      "A well-appreciated upgrade. Runs what I throw at it very well, although some games are starting to show its performance tier. Very good for the cost.",
      "It runs pretty cool and can run easily run MW3. I assume the small switch on the card is for crypto mining.",
      "Decent-looking and fair price of $299 AUD at the time of purchase. Does the job.",
      "This and the RX6650 XT are the best cards for 1080p gaming in 2023.",

      "This is an excellent graphics card--certainly the best one to launch in 2025, as far as I'm concerned. I got it on launch day for $750. I'm not pleased with that price, as it's really only worth it at $599, but I needed a GPU to put in a friend's new PC, and I didn't expect prices to normalize any time soon. Had I not been building a PC for a friend, I wouldn't have upgraded from the 6900XT at this price. It's only a 25% performance gain for roughly a 50% premium vs. the used market, and that's not even considering the ridiculous prices it's inflated to as of this review.\nThat said, the ray-tracing performance in particular is leagues beyond what I had on RDNA2. Monster Hunter Wilds Benchmark runs at >70 FPS average at 4k max settings, highest ray-tracing, and FSR Quality. Avowed and Jedi Survivor give roughly 55-60 FPS experiences at 4k Ultra with high RT and Quality upscaling. FSR4 also looks great in the approximately 5 games it's actually available for months after launch.\nOn principle, don't buy Nvidia 50-series, buy this instead.",
      "Best purchase of 2025! This card is an absolute beast for 1440p gaming, handling max settings in virtually every game I play. It runs cool, consistently staying under 60°C, and the smart fan feature is a fantastic bonus—when the GPU isn't in use, the fans stop running, keeping things nice and quiet. Highly recommend if you can get one for MSRP!"

      "The 5070 Ti is an aboslute monster. Runs amazingly well in almost all games. Can run most games max graphics without raytracing on at more than 60FPS. DLSS is required for playing with raytracing in modern games, however it gives great framerates with little degradation to the image quality, especially with DLSS 4. Handles VR great."

      "A 5080 is a 5080. Running a +2000 MHz memory OC with a mild undervolt. Idles ~38C, averages ~61C under gaming load. Wish there was more VRAM and wish I had access to a card that wasn't as overpriced, but it still has crazy raw power. Renders that previously took me overnight on my laptop now take me 30 seconds."

      "huge performance, although not used for gaming",
      "Upgraded from my 3050 Eagle. Plays all my games at 4k 60fps on Max settings. Helldivers 2, Project Wingman, Halo MCC, Probably wont upgrade till the 5080 Ti comes out. Only this holding it back is the 8GB VRAM, Shouldve had a 10GB version",
      "Coming from an RTX 2060 to this card definitely saw a large jump in performance, but an argument could be made for 8GB of VRAM being on the lower end for this price point in 2024.",
      "Performs better than I was expecting in 1440p and keeps cool under high load with a bit of fan curve tweaking.",
      "I was lucky enough to get this for MSRP in the fall of 2020 by pre-ordering through Canada Computers. This is now running a 3440x1440 144Hz display with great effectiveness. The fans stop at idle and light use (they stay still even with light gaming like Factorio), and I've always been happy with it's ability to cool itself without too much noise. I have however noticed higher temps recently, so the pads might be due for a change. I'm still very satisfied with the product.\nThank god I don't have to deal with the RGB Fusion UI to adjust the RGB logo and this works with SignalRGB.",
      "This thing is a powerhouse, it looks sleek, it has a nice size, and a nice little bit of RGB makes this GPU perfect for any gaming computer build. I couldn't be happier",
      "Found a cheap price online and bought a brand new one for only 800 NZD (500 USD). The card works perfectly fine for 1440p gaming and I can achieve high frame rates in a lot of the games that I play without any issue, and at least 60 fps in more graphics intensive games. If you can find one similar price to a 6700xt I would say to go with a 3070 but if not the 6700xt is probably a better option",
      "The GPU runs a bit hot but otherwise it is like any other 3070.",
      "Gigabyte RTX 3070 OC Edition- This hits hard I've only tested it in 2 games it is a flawless card of performance I will update this part of the comment after I make more use of it more (to give a proper saying) oh and its100x better then my 1050 mobile I used to use lmao",
      "This card looks great and disassembly is straight forward for those interested in installing a waterblock. This card utilizes flat 8-pin connectors at the pcb so be aware of that if you are looking to install a waterblock. The Bykski block I ordered came with flat 8-pin adapters but ended up making my own handmade cables."

      "I got this at £750 from UK overclockers. This GPU shreds any 1440p game I put in front of it at easily, considering it only slightly weaker than a 4080 and (at this current time) £400 cheaper its any easy 5 star from me.",
      "GPU prices in 2023 are... hectic to say the least. I was fortunate enough to find a reference 7900xt for less than $1400 near launch. Originally planned to get a 7900 xtx but at the time I was looking around for a GPU there was nothing that was below $1500, so I settled with a 7900xt. Great GPU though, I love this thing. Triple A games, I can run over 100 fps at 1440p with ease. At 4k, constantly over 30 fps and while not consistent, can hit 60 fps. Unfortunately doesn't fit the color scheme of my PC, but its whatever, I can live with it until I find a white GPU that suits my needs.",
      "Perfect match for my 240 Hz monitor. Call of duty stays at 200+ fps. Sometimes it drops to 180s or lower during engagements or high demanding graphic scenarios. An awesome price to performance card! Overclocking makes it even better. For the titles I play, this was the perfect card for me and much cheaper than my other options."

      "Originally wanted the RX 9070 XT but like so many others, don't want to wait indefinitely and don't have the time to be watching every website all day. I only have a 4k monitor and so far it has handled the games I have been playing well. I'm sure it'll only get better in 1440p. Stays SUPER cool. Make sure you check your cables and pins before install.\nIntended to vertical mount the card but between my tower cooler, the 5070 being absolutely massive, and the Be Quiet riser being a bit too lengthy it just didn't work. Maybe I dodged a bullet though, saw a post of someone with this card mounted vertically and the thermal gel was leaking out. Oh well. I think I like it better horizontally anyway."

      "It's good enough. 12 GB of VRAM on a 5070-named model is pathetic, but I agree with the PC enthusiasts, like Hardware Unboxed, when they say the 5070 is more like nVidia's X060 models now in all but name. Normally, I wouldn't suggest paying more than MSRP for this, but if you're in the United States as of early April 2025, it's hard to say what the impending tariffs will do to pricing here, plus availability being absolutely awful. I wouldn't recommend a 5070 for anything more than $650 pre-tariffs, but who knows, it could be an insane deal by the time the tariffs are in effect (if they end up affecting the GPU market, there's some rumors that semi-conductors will not be including in the tariffs, I don't know what the hell is going on or going to happen).\nThe best time in recent history to get a GPU or PC parts in general was around Black Friday 2024 or Summer 2024 (7800X3Ds were $330...). Just know if you're shopping for used graphics cards, the 5070 is comparable to a 4070 Super, give and take a few % depending on the game, so hopefully that advance can at least create a baseline for value you can use.\nThis particular model of 5070 is bare bones if even visually unimpressive, and if you have the Lancool 207 case, I would suggest a longer 3-fan GPU just for the better aesthetics, but even with just two fans, this GPU's temps are just fine under load, especially in the Lancool 207, which has excellent airflow with two fans running air right on to the GPU from it's vented basement. Running Cinebench R23, the GPU peaked after minutes at 71 Celsius and Monster Hunter Wilds on high settings at 1440p it was around 60 Celsius tops at 120+ FPS. Will update with Cyberpunk later if I remember to run it before it goes to it's eventual owner.\nI'd recommend the AMD RX 9070 XT or even an RX 9070 at MSRP before this, but I saw this for $549.99 ($563 after shipping) on Newegg and was able to \"Add To Cart\" and didn't care to think on it much with how the GPU market, even the used GPU market, is now days."

      "Solid card, mine has coil wine which is unfortunate but is normal",
      "This card was chosen due to it being white but besides it's a great card with good thermals and the 7800xt is plenty of power for anyone in 1080p or 1440p.",
      "Best budget 1440p card imo. (With at least 16GB VRAM)",

      "Got it for a relatively cheap price compared to other options in my country. Consider it a win so far as I haven’t had any performance issues related to the gpu. Also runs cool and fans aren’t that loud.",
      "got this GPU for 420$ on amazon, too insane to pass on, bought it for one of my 1440p white builds. plays most games at 1440p ultra 80+ fps in extreme quality demanding gaming like cod, cyberpunk and red dead",
      "I bought this GPU at a very reasonable price, best buy I ever made, absolute beast for 1440p",
      "My roommate has a 4070ti and this performs about the same until more vram becomes necessary and then it pulls ahead. Great gpu: people need to stop sleeping on AMD considering the performance per dollar.",
      "Managed to snatch this one up on the Prime Day deal and have not regretted it. I had heard bad things about AMD graphics cards, but I just not shell out more for an NVIDIA 4070 or higher at this point. I did have my worries, but I have been more than satisfied so far. It runs what I need it to at close to 180 fps at all times, and I'm pretty sure that it is being capped by my monitor, not the card itself. I don't play anything that I believe would be considered overly intensive (RimWorld, Lies of P, Starfield, Deadlock, Fortnite), but I didn't quite expect to see that kind of FPS at max settings for those some of those games either, so I consider this an absolute win for me.",
      "Got this beast of a card for just $40 after returning my 3060 Ti. Thievery. Complete steal. Very very cool and silent at that. Not too big, either. Fits my 4000D Airflow case with more than enough room to spare. No RGB, just pure performance. Would take this over an aesthetically pleasing but underperforming card any day of the week."

      "Great Card",
      "I can now trust ebuyer the online shop. It came in lovely packaging and was made out of good quality stuff. Nothing was broken and it performs most games, well 90-95% of games at 1080p High/Ultra settings at 60+ FPS. So all in all a great card for not just gaming it can also help out with editing and rendering.",
      "Right now, at ~ $460, I would hold on if I could. If the prices ever return to normality, you could probably snatch an RTX 3070 at this price point. Otherwise, cooling is fine and the design is pretty sleek and fancy. If you have to buy a card right now, this is a decent option.",

      "GPUs are getting out of hand. This was the cheapest 7900xtx available for me, but it is awkwardly too long for many ITX cases.\nI have no problems running it, haven't built a system in a while so the tried many different fans to cool the GPU junction. I encounter no coil whine, the fans on the device are fine. After using Asrock products, I really think they're quality has improved over Gigabyte and Asus.",
      "This thing is sweet. You have the option of only downloading the GPU drivers and not the extra AMD software, but it doesn't take up much resources anyway so I use them. It has uses 3 8 pin PCIE slots to power it. Id recommend buying an 8 to 6+2 PCIE cable specifically for it if your PSU doesn't come with one.",
      "This is aging like a nice wine. At first the drivers wouldn't update at all via AMD Adrenaline, but now it is the perfect overpowered GPU that I needed for gaming.",
      "Wanted the fasted GPU that didn't have that stupid melting power cable. Works great, runs quiet, plays anything at 1440p above 165Hz on high presets",
      "I took my chance and bought this refurbished, saving about $200 USD over a new, in-the-box model. So far, it is good. I have read plenty of reports about this unit having extreme hotspot temperatures compared to other models. Ideally, it should be undervolted and the thermal paste/pad replaced (which I will do at some point in the future) to bring the temperature back in control. The card also tends to sag, so a support bracket or vertical mounting kit is recommended.",
      "Good performance at a good price but had to return the first one due to hotspot temps going over 100° at stock settings. Second one runs slightly below 100° on hotspot.",
      "First AMD GPU and I absolutely love it! Currently waiting on my 360hz OLED but at the moment I am running a 240hz LG 1440p where I have the frames capped at 237 and it pretty much stays on 237 in Destiny 2 and MW3.",
      "Main buy reason was the price here as well. Originally I wanted to go for a 7900XT, but when I saw I could get the XTX for under 1000€ I choose this. Only downside is the RBG. Without an ARGB cable, which would look very bad in my case, you can't control the RGB. You can only turn it off. Expected more for nearly 1000€",
      "Great card that handles anything thrown at it",
      "Had read some poor reviews unfortunately already after I purchased this card from Microcenter. Debated exchanging for something else but avoided the hassle and installed it anyway. It's been running great. GPU temp at 65C with average FPS 158 during FurMark 4K test. Playing Halo Infinity and getting 144FPS with junction temps at 93C and current temps hovering mid 65C after increasing fan curve slightly. Love the RBG. Does make some noise but I don't mind with over-ear headphone on and for the price, is everything I wanted to play in 4k. Will have to return to this after testing it out some more on some other games and for a longer time."

      "First AMD card. Super happy I went with this it. It is 12 GB VRAM instead of the 4060 which is only 8 GB. The price difference in my country was only around ~15 bucks between the 4060 (non TI) and the 7700XT, and if we wanted to we could have spent another 20 bucks to get a 7800XT but it would not fit in the Micro-ATX case.",
      "I love this card. It was between this and a 4060 ti 8 gb for me. I'm glad I went with the extra VRAM because some games are already using close to all of my 12gb, albeit without that sweet sweet ray tracing.",
      "BIG FRAMERATE.",
      "I got boned by the 7800xt dropping and all the reviewers praising it, so they were totally out when I went to purchase one. This card still rocks. Handles 1440p gaming at triple digit figures on just about any game not named Starfield (which was included at the time of purchase. so much for that!)",
      "Beautiful GPU, plays any game I throw at it at 1440p 144hz."
