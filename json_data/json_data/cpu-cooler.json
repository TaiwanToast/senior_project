      "Good cooler, keeps my Ryzen 5 7600X under 80°C and fits in a mini-ITX case. Thermal paste wasn't very fluid though, you could probably buy some.",
      "Decently easy assembly. (am5) Cools my 9800x3d more than enough. Fans were a bit loud for my liking, but still much more silent compared to my last PC.",
      "It's big, it's a little awkward installing... but it's effective and pretty with RGB fans! And for $35??!?!? Fantastic!",
      "Super smooth and quiet, both when idle and under load. Sadly, the motherboard's UEFI menu didn't let it run at zero fan speed, even after going through what Asus calls 'Q-fan Tuning' (which tries to detect the lowest supported fan speed for all fans). The lowest it let me go was 15%.\nInstallation was pretty straightforward. The fan comes with thermal paste, so you don't have to buy it separately. The fan cables also have adapters to daisy-chain them. However, the heat sink has sharp fins, so take care not to cut yourself (which happened to me 😅).",
      "Working just fine, quiet too. That's why it's always recommended.",
      "Easy to install and keeps things cool. Kept a 7600x at 85 degrees in Cinebench in my most recent build.",
      "You will not regret getting this cooler. Inexpensive, but extremely powerful. Will keep your CPU cool through a camel ride through the sahara! Excellent price to performance",
      "One of, if not; the best Air cpu coolers on the market.",
      "This is an incredible value product, keeping my Ryzen 7 7700X CPU down to a cool 64 C even under a full gaming load. Two cooling towers, two fans, and 6 heat pipes connecting both towers for a very low cost of under $CDN 50 which both undercuts and performs just as well as similar two tower air coolers from more well-known brands. Highly recommended.",

Does a good job of preventing the CPU from climbing much higher than ~70°C, even at very high loads, and brings it back down fairly quickly. Rather quiet for its size, I think, anyway.",
      "Has no problem cooling this CPU. Will update info.",
      "Is a little loud, but works very well.",
      "Ran out to BestBuy on the day of my build. Got it for $30 or so and has been great. Jerry-rigged another fan onto it for better cooling and its been solid. Can't complain",
      "Going on year three operates around 50 Celsius with every CPU I've thrown at it. Staple of it's market.",
      "I was swayed by all the years of praise that the 212 has gotten. In retrospect I should have picked up something a bit better but overall I'm happy."

      "For cooling, I went with the Liquid Freezer III 360. This is my first AIO, and so far, I'm very pleased with it. I replaced the stock fans with three Arctic P12 MAX, which probably hasn't made any real difference. Maybe it's a little louder than stock; I don't know. I had heard that the mounting onto the mobo would be a little tricky, but I experienced no problems at all with the installation .",
      "Keeps 7800X3D cool under load, good value",
      "Bought for 90 USD from Amazon in January 2025. Planned on getting a Phantom Spirit 120 Evo, but reconsidered seeing various great reviews for this AIO for $40 more. Runs very quiet and is overkill for my current CPU (so I've been told), though still am considering an air cooler in the future.",
      "Keeps temps right where they should be!",
      "Keeps my CPU cool, but the mounting process is a bit unclear",
      "Best value cooler for power hungry chips imo. No rgb, no ******** displays, just a beefy thick radiator. Keeps a 253 watt 14900k under 70°. The installation on Intel is a breeze, no extreme pressure or force required. The pump is somewhat noisy at 100% speed, but it is PWM controlled and can be slowed down significantly with a fan curve. Stock fans connection that goes through the tubes is weird as it only has 2 pins. I ended up wiring the fans myself with a proper 4 pin cable. VRM fan is comically small, but I guess it does... something. At least it is quiet even at full rpm.",
      "Really effective, but its a big beefy cooler. Literally bigger than my GPU",
      "Clearly very capable. I had a little trouble mounting the block onto the CPU mounts. I suspect the mounting brackets have a tiny bit of play when screwing in, so they weren't weren't exactly perfectly positioned on my first attempt. This stopped the block from screwing in. Would've liked more than 0.8g of MX-6, but this is adequate for at least a couple applications. Super pricing.\nI checked compatibility with the motherboard before purchasing. Highly recommended to do so beforehand as the pump/waterblock can be impeded by high VRM and/or NVME SSD heatsinks.",
      "The best AIO out there, while also one of the cheapest? Count me in. Keeps my overclocked + undervolted 9800X3D below 60c while gaming. Only drawback, but I won’t take off a start for that, is its mounting mechanism. Could be easier. My suggestion is, mount the 2x provided black metal rails ON THE PUMP first, and then try mounting all the thing on the motherboard, not the opposite way (which is what the manual says). If you go with what the manual says, the screws on the pump will NEVER reach the metal rails.",

      "Nice and quiet, I don’t think I can hear it up until about 50 percent fan speed which is barely ever. Seemed to be really good value too.",
      "Easy to install, keeps my CPU cool under stress, and looks great in my case. What more could you ask for? I think it brings a tasteful level of RGB without going overboard. And for how cheap it is, it's a great value.",
      "Its cheap, looks cool, lights up, and keeps my cpu plenty cool.",
      "Got the RGB one because it was cheaper at the time. Replaced the middle fan with a P12 Max and at the side (over the RAM) only a slim one could fit without touching the cables that power the MOBO. Needed to dremmel the side bracket that holds the Noctua fan a little bit so the heatpipes didn't touch it, but it fits perfectly apart from that.",
      "I chose this over ID Cooling's A620 Pro SE even though the PS120SE costs $5 more just because I did not like the build quality of the former unit.\nAFAIK, Frost Spirit > Frost Commander > Phantom Spirit > Peerless Assassin. \"SE\" models have a small height difference (e.g. 154 mm vs 157 mm in heatsink specs for PS120SE vs PS120) but perform the same (fan specs/noise level/air flow et al.) and are cheaper. Just pick from any of the 4 models that fits in your budget and/or build aesthetic.\nRefer:\nWhat's the difference between all these Thermalright coolers?\nIt is a non-issue for me but I did notice that I had to put more pressure installing this cooler as compared to other CPU coolers I have installed in the past. Still, documenting here for posterity.\nI had no issues with RAM clearance. Just check the dimensions of whatever RAM + CPU cooler combination you select. Thermalright's website might be lacking in design but they are very upfront about their product specs and do not hide anything from you.",
      "I came across the cooler on my own as I knew I wanted a fan and not water cooled. After I did some research I found out that this is a really popular cooler. The price is amazing! Performance reviews showed that it was a really good cooler for half the price as its competitors. Easy to install. It does come with its own thermal paste but I used Arctic MX-6 paste instead. The size is a bit on the large end so I had to get low profile RAM stick for it to fit under the cooler's fan. Keeps my CPU temps very cool even under a load. I am now an advocate for the Thermalright brand.",
      "This is one of highest value CPU coolers you can buy for $48CAD. It keeps my 7600x very cool~50°C under load and the fans are quiet. The only minor downside is the length of the ARGB cable. It is NOT long enough to run up and over the motherboard, behind and up from the bottom with a mATX motherboard. However, thanks to the coolers size, I could run it down the front of the motherboard and behind the graphics card without it being visible. Also, no matter what I do in the BIOS to the fan curves, it is impossible to make them stop spinning when idle. That might just be a skill issue though. This cooler fits in the NZXT H5 Flow 2023 with the front fan raised by ~5mm due to RAM clearance with a G Skill Trident RGB kit.",
      "Great at cooling, but it takes up quite a bit of space. Regardless it's easy to set up and gets the job done!"

Easy installation, and it came with MX-6 and a contact frame which I didn't know, which is even more awesomer.",

      "Affordable liquid cooler with reasonable performance.",
      "If I had to describe this cooler, I'd describe it the same way I would myself: quiet, cool, and surprisingly good-looking. The included fans are quiet, and the split cable for the fans, pump, and vrm fan makes setting separate curves easy as pie. I do wish it wasn't as massive, and that the daisy chaining for the fans was a little cleaner, but those are very minor complaints all things considered. Update: replaced the included fans with D30-120 Reverse blades as I'm moving it to a side intake instead of top exhaust.",
      "In all honesty I expected CPU temps to be lower even performing a CPU torture test like Cinebench multi-threaded, but 80ºC with some 15ºC ambient temps is uncomfortable, to say the least, considering summers where I live can easily reach 40ºC. It's possible it's partially on me (I have a massive skill issue and I had to mount the cooler thrice), though. That aside, instalation was a lot easier than was foretold by reviewers and some friends with variants of this product.",
      "Its a great AIO for the price. keeps my 7800X3D under 78C when gaming for long periods of time. Only reason i docked 1 star is when installing the cooler on the CPU... MAN its annoying. Make sure to not screw 1 side too much because it'll be a pain to screw the other side in.",

I had to wait 2 days while actively trying to keep my thermal paste from drying out. Other than that, I think it performs pretty well for an air cooler, being slightly worse than the 240 AIO that I had. It is a little louder than I expected, but it keeps my CPU cool.",

      "Keeps my i7 12700K very cold, on idle hovers around 48C, and under High graphic settings can go as high as 65C. The only complaint I have is how I wish Noctua would realize that the 2nd 140mm fan they provide will not fit nicely as it will be sitting over the RAM and would not be flush with the heat sinks. So in order to have it nice and flush on the front I put a 120mm Noctua Fan and change the brown silicon edges for white ones off of amazon.\nOverall, a great wind cooler that still performs as good or even better than many water coolers out there for a great price.",
      "For cooling, I went with the reliable Noctua NH-D15, expecting that its massive heatsink and two fans paired with a low-wattage CPU would result in very cool temperatures. The Noctua cooler just barely fits and clears the RAM. Under 100% load in AIDA64, the CPU's maximum temperature is 65°C, and the GPU's maximum temperature is 56°C.",

I countered this by swapping out the stock fans with some Lian Li 120mms, which also helps match the rest of the fans in my case. Was thinking of going with Lian Li's Galahad AIO but I heard a lot of horror stories about that one and decided to stick to NZXT. The NZXT cam app can be a little cumbersome at times but having Lain on the panel makes it worth every penny. You also have to make sure you plug it into the right fan slot on your motherboard or else the app will not detect your fan and it won't function at all.\nOn the flipside. is so much fun to mess around with and customize. Having a running GIF of Lain \"guarding\" my CPU has definitely given my build an aura. The cooler has also made my computer the quietest I've ever heard.

Relatively easy to install, but I wish it came with a physical manual. I missed a step during installation because it wasn't listed in the online manual's \"installation\" section but in a separate \"choose connector\" section which was annoying because it meant removing it from the CPU mount after applying it to the CPU.\nThe radiator is quite thick so be sure to take that into account for your build.\nSome people have complained about the screw length being too short for the CPU mount. I kinda get it, the screws are relatively short, but applying a little bit of pressure onto the mount made it a non-issue and they screwed into the threads properly.",
      "Surprisingly good for a 240mm AIO. Never did I see my 9700x get above 70C and never do I see this 7950x3D get over 80C unless running a synthetic benchmark.\nGreat work Arctic!",
      "I can't even see the fan spinning on the cpu, it's fantastic!",
      "Thick radiator, strong pump, quiet fans, no RGB. Fantastic.",
      "Based on my research and recommendations, this is the best cooler for an SFF build this year. I deducted one star because the stock fan on the radiator is a bit thick and touches the motherboard's wiring, preventing it from running properly. -- I ended up purchasing a fan grill instead of opting for a thinner fan like the Noctua. It's quiet and does a great job of controlling heat.",
      "The lack of cables and ease of installation is a massive pro. It's whisper silent, with not a ton of weird pump noise that I seem to hear a lot in lianli and NZXT AIOs. Super quiet and for the price, punches well above its weight class.",
      "I really thought I'd need a better cooler for my 9900X, but it turns out the Arctic Freezer III is built different. My 9900X idles at ~40C and never goes above 75C during load. According to reviewers this the best aio performance you can get on AM5.\nThe radiator is notably thicker (38mm compared to the standard 27mm), and the tubes are long and not very flexible. It may not fit in all cases so keep that in mind."

      "Haven't done too much with this build, but so far from playing Monster Hunter Wilds, this cools the same for the 9700X as the Noctua NH-D15 Chromax does for the 7800X3D that's in my main build. In fairness, the 9700X is less power hungry than a 7800X3D. The Phantom Spirit may not look as impressive as a D15, but it's also ~1/4th the price. As long as the fans can last a few years without the bearings going out, it's a win. CPU Cooling solutions, along with PC Cases and monitors AND unlike GPUs, thankfully seem to be in a great spot so far in early 2025 with plenty decent and competitive options available.",
      "Works great at cooling a 7800x3d. Fans sound good even when pushed to higher RPMs, making a deeper rumble than the higher pitched fans I'm used to.",
      "Fantastic cooler probably more than a Core 15 13400F needed but bigger cooling=lower fans speed so im for it",
      "Great CPU cooler. There really isn't much else to say. It performs well, it's easy to assemble and it's very quiet.",
      "Remarkably performant for its price. However, while silent, the loudest frequencies still hit the ear hard. This is irrelevant since it's still quiet and performant, so I'm giving it the rating it deserves. Oh, and the free thermal paste is nice.",
      "Cooling ability is great; CPU does not go over 75 degrees, even at continued 100% load. However, I could only fit one fan in the middle. The front of the cooler is partially blocked by the motherboard's USB3 header, and the back of the port is too small to accommodate a 120mm fan. In the end, I just mounted the 92mm fan that came included with my case as the \"second\" fan for the cooler. Still very good cooling performance.",
      "Does what everybody said it would do. It keeps the CPU cool, and it's whisper quiet.",
      "A third the price of the NH-D15, yet better performance in some scenarios. It just doesn't get better than that.",
      "Really good performance for a very accessible price",
      "Literally the best out there, aside from noctua. (Which costs four times as much) Cools my 3570k to 45c at 4.2ghz. In a good case, at 60 percent fans, i can get idle temps down to 22c. Absolutely silent at anything below 45 percent speed. It was pretty easy to install, and came with an entire tube of thermal paste, rather than having thermal paste applied to the bottom. Worth every penny."

      "Installation was easy. NZXT has solved many previous headaches with this AIO, especially in the cabling department. Everything is routed through the radiator in one break-out cable, nothing is attached to the pump head, which is brilliant! The pump head is massive but I believe necessary to display all the metrics. CAM software has also come a long way from when I used it years ago. The big plus is that it doesn't tax system resources like it used to. The fans are also one assembly. No cables. No mess. Nice. The cooling performance is on par keeping my 9900X at agreeable temperatures under stress.",
      "Easy to install, looks great but from some angles the screen looks weird but that might be my fault",
      "Expensive cooler, has connection issues but it was because of the bad USB extender I had. Make sure you buy the NZXT Internal hub with this thing so it can be detected by the software. Looks amazing! Performs decently well but you can spend 75% less and have the same performance. Lets be real, the only thing that you want out of this CPU cooler is the screen and the looks. The software is really easy to use and can be used with all NZXT devices.",
      "Very Beautiful AIO, with simple installation and cool centrepiece to any build",

      "It cools my CPU very well, the LCD screen is a nice touch.",
      "Very aesthetically pleasing and I love the customisable LCD screen. A little pricey though..",
      "A very good cooler, easy to install and didn't find any issues. All the connectors for the pump is easy to use and like how it uses SATA for power. Does use a USB port but this is standard. Performance of the pump and radiator are very good, and often find that I do not need to push the fans hard to reach optimal cooling. However, it is unfortunate it does not save your preferences for the screen configurations and colouring for the fans if NZXT CAM is turned off. I consider all of these software to be bloatware, and it's unfortunate I have to keep this running. But still a great AIO CPU cooler.",
      "Super easy install. I love the screen, and the fans are super silent. Keeps my CPU nice and cool, even under load. The software could be better but still good.",

My 7700X idles at around 35-38C, but it hits that 83C mark when at 100% load. That could be number of user errors from bad fan curves to inadequate thermal paste application though, so it's not affecting my review, especially because for my use case my CPU only ever hits 100% load for short durations during shader precaching.",

The only downside is that by default even on silent pump profile it runs at 2300RPM and you can't make it lower in the Corsair iCUE app. It can be annoying in silent builds, but luckily it is possible to bypass this through a simple config file manipulation and change it to 1940RPM which makes it silent without sacrificing performance.",

It probably works good on other CPUs that don't run as hot, but I haven't witnessed it myself, so I can't say for certain, hence why it is a 3-star rating.\nPros: - Comes with thermal paste. I am unsure how good it is but I really appreciated it nonetheless and happily used it. - Installation was easy.\nCons: - Comes with a paper with some kind of text that is written entirely in what seems to be Japanese, and there are no other instructions or anything in the box. - You have to find a video online detailing how to install it. - Seemingly runs uncomfortably hot on the Ryzen 5 7600X."

You can hear the pump whirring from time to time, but only if you don't have headphones on and even without, it's not annoying. A negative point for me (more for visual reasons) are the tubes, unfortunately you can't lay them very nicely. With the Lian Li HydroShift, for example, the tubes are routed along the radiator, which makes it possible to lay them almost \"invisibly\" in the case.\nIn idle, the Ryzen 7 7800x3d tends to be in the higher temperature range, around 55-60°C (which is supposed to be normal according to the Internet).\nUnder load, however, it doesn't get warmer than 78°C, which is perfectly fine for me.

      "Massive chungus of a cooler, but it keeps the Ryzen 7 9800x3d cool and does it in a reasonably quiet fashion. My CPU runs around 34-35c idle, 65c while gaming and maxed out at 81c during the Cinebench 10 mins test. The only thing I didn't like was the included thermal paste. It was so thick, it was more like thermal bubble gum, so I knocked a star off.",
      "tames a 9800X3D heat in gaming, but the install directions aren't the best",
      "Excellent cooling. I could not find instructions on how tight the two spring loaded screws should be tightened. I hate when something is underspecified and left for the user to just figure out. I then kind of tightened them half way. Looking at the temps, it seems to be working well.",
      "Amazing cooler, ran extremely quietly and cooled amazingly, 10/10 love thermalright, would recommend for anyone on a budget, even their AIOs, like the simple RGB aswell",
      "Very nice cooler. Neat design with simple RGB which I appreciate. However I found it very hard to screw the cooler in place with the CPU. The screws are between the radiators which makes it very difficult to screw. But otherwise good product.",
      "The fan gets quite noisy if you allow it go up all the way to 2100 RPM, so I'd definitely recommend adjusting the fan curve to top out at a lower level. Something like 1500 RPM is sufficient to sustain 5GHz all-core frequency on the 9950X under load.\nGenerally not a fan of RGB, but I quite like the subdued RGB effect on this cooler.",
      "Insane bang for your buck. Beats AIO Coolers 3 times its price. The only downside is that the double towers are HUGE and there is almost no clearance from the RAM. If you want to remove/reseat RAM, you will need to at least remove the right side fan.",
      "I'm going to be honest, I got this cooler mainly because of aesthetics. It's Thermalright so it goes without saying that it performs great, but it's barely better than the Phantom Spirit 120. For an extra 20 bucks I get a sleek black look and a little touch of RGB. Worth it to me.",
      "Live in the Southern US and keeps the 7800X3D cool. Not that it would take much. Big tower cooler for the board though, so sort of locked into one configuration if you want your RAM accessible.",
      "Easily the top 2 (may not even be #2) air coolers on the market. If you don't trust AIO/Water cooling, or if you're paranoid about your first build and planning on doing any heavy gaming/productivity, the Phantom Spirit EVO will keep your CPU ice cold."

      "Simple Installation. The software is easy to use and the LCD looks pretty cool.",
      "There are definitely cheaper AIOs out there, but as far as NZXT products go this is pretty fairly priced. Looks amazing when paired with their cases and has zero issues cooling my 7800X3D, however the cooling performance of this AIO could easily be matched by a higher-end air cooler. NZXT CAM software is far above any other AIO software I have used, and customizing things such as the LCD or fan/pump curves is extremely easy.",
      "Not the cooler i wanted, i dont care for fancy BS.

Also it is kinda neat i can have a picture of Trigun.",

Extremly silent at both Performance and Quiet modes. You get thermal paste and a really nice screwdriver with it in the box.",

Enough for using it on 2 applications so unless you need or want a different paste you can save money using what's in the box. It was easy to fit and use. Just be aware that if you want to change a CPU in the LA1700 holder, you need to remove the brackets you install to hold the cooler. Design in regards to this could've been smarter but I'd hope a future edition will address this.",
      "I love the all dark non RGB aesthetics. Performance is really good, especially for the noise levels. The Silent Wings keep this cooler very quiet. One minor complaint is the non-standard custom solution for the middle fan. If that breaks you can't replace it with a standard 140 or 120 mm fan, you'd have to reach out to Be Quiet! for a replacement unit, since it is fixed onto a bracket. I hear customer support is quite good though so I am not too worried.",

      "Looks nice! But does it cool as nice as it looks? no! save your money and get a cheap tower cooler! my ram sticks are running 2 °C hotter after swaping out the Wraith Spire and Installing this due to the cooler blowing hot air right to the ram sticks and vrms. the ssd heatsink get hotter aswell and the ssd is running at 50 °C in game and idles at 40 °C",
      "Quite loud compared to other fans. Cools well though",
      "This came with my Ryzen 7 7700, and I used it for the first couple weeks. Looks great, but poor performance and terrible noise above 40% RPM. Would idle in the mid-40s, then jump to the 70s at 25% load, and was just distractingly loud. There are much better budget options, like the Thermalright Assassin Spirit 120 EVO, DeepCool AK400, and Cooler Master Hyper 212 Halo. Or if you need even better performance, get a Thermalright Peerless Assassin or Phantom Spirit. It's worth the upgrade.",

The aesthetics are quite nice though having to install a piece of software just for it is a bit annoying. Only complaints are it can get quite loud under load and the pre-applied thermal paste ended up crusting after a year.",

      "Pretty amazing for the price. Defiantly not the highest performer when maintaining temps but it does its job really well for the price. Only issue is mounting on an AM5 platform was way more complicated than it should be and wished it was easier. Looks amazing and the included fans preform well so other than the difficult installation process, it's a great AIO.",
      "hard to assemble with the motherboard but just daisy chain em",
      "Keeps the CPU decently cooled. Aesthetics are very nice.",
      "Ok for the price",
      "I'm not sure about this cooler yet. For the price, absolutely a home-run. Install instructions are lacking at best. Let me explain:\nI am questioning the AM5 mounting system for this cooler. The instructions say to install the water block bracket at an angle, line up the arrow on the block and the bracket and rotate clock-wise to secure it. Well, when I rotate the bracket, it doesn't lock in, rather it just sits in the block and will slide out and fall off the block very easily if you don't physically hold it on. This became an issue when it came time to install the block onto my CPU. As I stated already, it likes to rotate out and fall off since it won't lock in place. I was still able to install it, but I had to hold the bracket in place to prevent it from moving while I mounted the block to the CPU. Interestingly this cooler uses the factory mounting brackets that come on AMD motherboards, don't often see that, but it made installing the water block super easy minus the bracket issue.\nSo, since the bracket won't lock in properly, it makes the LED logo on the block look crooked, or un-level. This can't be the correct way to install the water block if you ask me. So far temps don't seem too bad, but I need to get a second monitor to check the real-time temps while I play a few games. So far it idles around 45-47C.\nLEDs on the fans look good, fans are quiet enough. They're not Noctua or Be Quiet! fans, but they are certainly serviceable. The radiator came with one little bent fin on the top but it was hidden since its facing the top of my case so no real issue there. Tubing looks like, block looks like good quality. I would recommend getting a different thermal paste because the one provided seems very sketchy. It feels very thick and dry, not very spreadable. I might change the paste once I see my real time gaming temps.\nKnocking off 1 star so far because of the bracket mounting issue. If I figure out a solution, I'll edit my review. Did anyone else with this cooler run into this problem, or am I an idiot for not doing something obvious to lock the bracket into place?",
      "Cheap, reliable, looks great. Amazing CPU Cooler for almost any CPU.",

I would put my finger on the Wraith Stealth's fan to stop it and suddenly the system seemed near-silent. The Assassin King has a single fan and tower with five heat pipes, which seemed suitable for cooling my CPU--I don't overclock it. (I added this cooler before upgrading from a Ryzen 3600 to a Ryzen 5700X3D CPU, but I think it's able to cool the 5700X3D well enough.) A dual tower air cooler would cool more effectively, but my primary reason for adding this was to reduce noise and a dual tower air cooler would have two fans. Also, a dual tower air cooler would weigh twice as much, which concerned me because coolers are mounted to the motherboard, which is vertical.\nIt's much quieter than the Wraith Stealth. My case and PSU are white, so this matched. Also, it has ARGB, which I like.",

Plus, installation is a breeze. Specifically chosen for this case (downdraft cooler) due to the 80mm fan exhaust position. This allows the CPU fan to draw hot air away from the CPU, while the 80mm case fan expels the hot air out of the case. There was no stock of the Thermalright AXP90-X53, but I would have chosen Noctua anyway."

The AIO comes with a fan controller that works with the single pack SL-INF Uni fans.\nThe only thing that threw me off on this was the mounting on this GA II Trinity was different from previous models I had seen in youtube videos. I have no idea when Lian Li changed this but it must have been within the past few months. The model I got did not have the \"clip\" mounting brackets for AMD. I had to remove the top and bottom brackets from my MOBO, screw 4 long mounting pins into those holes in the MOBO, and then the mounting bracket that went onto the pump screwed onto the 4 long mounting pins. It was a bit confusing as I didn't have any videos to reference but I eventually got it on successfully. In retrospect, this was probably an upgrade from the clip brackets older models had.",

I do have some odd frequencies from the case sometimes but they're very subtle and depend on the angle of my head. But none of the sounds I hear from my case bother me, so I'm assuming it doesnt make any noise really or that it is quiet enough for me to not care.",
      "Would've gone with a 360mm AIO but live and learn",

      "I'd go without the LCD version for your builds. Mine came with a damaged LCD cap and Corsair suggested I replace the entire unit (instead of just sending me / swapping with me for a new cap). Otherwise, keeps things quite cool (in both definitions).",
      "Wanted to try my hand at RGB. Corsair price tax is high though.",
      "Pleasantly surprised with this AIO, looks amazing and keeps CPU very cool. No noise complaints at time of review.",
      "Installation was really simple and easy, did not expect it to be that easy. Keeps the CPU cool, and pretty quite.",
      "This a very nice AIO cooler. The LCD cap is removable and can be swapped out for other caps if you choose to. So far under gaming load, my PC is running at about 36 degrees C. The pump and fans are fairly quiet on basic use but you can definitely hear it while gaming. I do wish that the tubes were slightly shorter considering the sizes of newer GPU. Mine is a 3070 Ti so it was not too bad, but the tubes were rubbing up against the GPU in every other configuration except the one I am using now.",
      "New iCUE Link system is amazing. so few cables to manage. the pump is definitely quieter than the previous CoolIT ones, like by a lot. the only complaints are the price and the fact it requires a 6pin from the psu instead of the sata cables so if you run a Radeon which requires 3 8pins or a RTX 3080/3090 etc that also requires 3 8pins gonna be imcompatible.",
      "Corsair iCUE LINK TITAN 360 Review: Cooling Power With Style If you’re looking for a cooler that can keep up with your high-end gaming or streaming setup, the Corsair iCUE LINK TITAN 360 is here to blow you away. This thing packs a huge 360mm radiator, three beastly 120mm fans, and all the cool features you need to take your PC’s cooling to the next level—while looking awesome while doing it.\nSeriously Powerful Cooling Let’s talk performance: the 360mm radiator means this cooler is built for heavy-duty cooling. Whether you’re pushing your CPU to the max with overclocking or gaming for hours, the three 120mm fans have got your back, keeping your rig cool and stable even under the most intense workloads.\nEasy Control with iCUE One of the best things about this cooler is its iCUE integration. If you’re already familiar with Corsair’s iCUE software, you know it’s a game-changer. With iCUE, you can easily control fan speeds, RGB lighting, and even pump speeds all from your PC. Want to switch up the look of your system? Just use iCUE to play with the RGB effects—whether you want a chill vibe or a full-blown light show, it’s all at your fingertips.\nSimple Installation Despite its massive 360mm radiator, the iCUE LINK TITAN 360 is actually pretty easy to install. Corsair’s tool-free mounting system makes it simple to get the cooler set up quickly, and the flexible tubing means you won’t be struggling to fit it into your case. Plus, the anti-vibration mounts keep everything nice and steady, making sure the cooler stays quiet.\nQuiet But Mighty What’s impressive about this cooler is that, even though it’s packing some serious cooling power, it’s still super quiet. The fans run quietly when your system is chilling, but when you’re pushing your rig, they ramp up and keep the noise levels in check. It's like having all the performance without the noise.\nFinal Thoughts: A Killer Cooler With a Clean Look The Corsair iCUE LINK TITAN 360 is everything you need in a cooler: serious performance, easy control, and killer looks. If you’re building a high-performance rig and want something that can handle the heat while also looking awesome, this cooler is a no-brainer.",

My only criticism is that the manual could use some improvement, which has been the case for more than one of the Thermalright coolers I have used thus far.",

      "Good cooler, i'd prefer a custom loop tho",
      "Really nice and cheap AIO, no problems so far, performs really great, my CPU idles AT around 60° when gaming, the fans are pretty silent"

      "Wanted a white cooler for aesthetics and this worked. Fans can get a little audible during high cpu load, about 1500 rpm. Lowered peak to 1300 mhz and its not that loud. Overall nice cooler, love the frosted white heat pipes too.",
      "The cooler does its job pretty well, considering it’s in a relatively small case. Temps stay around 40°C at idle and up to 63°C when gaming. Thermal paste used is Arctic MX-6.",
      "Instructions were unclear, but with a little bit of logic and he was thinking it was absolutely easy to install and amazing. You could also move the fans around so it doesn’t block your motherboard and it looks so nice.",
      "Keeps my CPU under 70 degrees under load, love it and the look.",
      "Great cooler, keeps my temps low for what I need.\nUnfortunately one of the fans needs to sit higher to support my ram.",
      "Easy install, the package comes with multiple sets of brackets for your build. Brackets are easy to install, the trickiest part for me was screwing down the dual heat sink to the bracket. Mounting the dual fans is a breeze. Watch out for clearance with your ram! I had to play a little bit with the mounting of the fans, but it worked out. The width of the cooler covers up my RAM sticks entirely (no need for rgb here). The build quality exceeded my expectations and have been happy with the performance so far. It may have been slight overkill for the 7800x3d, but it’s pound for pound the undefeated cooling champion for me at this price point.",
      "Works great, keeps my Ryzen 9 7900x nice and cool, problem is with my motherboard, the IO Shield/space i have to raise one of the fans slightly higher than the one in the center, and i cannot have it on the opposite side or it'll be blocking my ram (though it has clips you can VERY easily remove, it'd block the RGB of the ram regardless :\"C )",
      "Thermalright is the value king right now. Managed to snag a white version which was only about a dollar more than the black version. Looks really clean and performs really well, used the thermal paste that came with it and it seems to be doing just fine. The only complaint (that doesn't even apply to my build) is that this cooler is MASSIVE it almost touches the side panel on my PC and covers most of my motherboard and my ram. Luckily my ram is low profile, if you have tall ram definitely consider before buying but you can always adjust the fan height.",
      "Very happy with this, does its job excellently. Just a little bit on the bulky side, so I had to raise the fans a little bit over the ram sticks, so it barely fitted in my case, and hides the rgb ram sticks. Nonetheless the cooling is excellent.",
      "Amazing cooler from the price. Thermalright never misses with their budget air coolers."

      "I have a 5700X and I'm only using the middle fan so it looks less bulky and even with just one fan it's awesome. Stress test: 16 threads at 100% 85W (PBO) constant 4.6GHz CPU temp at 79C, ambient at 25C",
      "Good looking, cheap, quiet, cool, etc. If you have a 7800X3D then I don't see why you'd ever buy something else. (if you're not building SFF)",
      "Pretty good cooler, the fans it comes with aren't the best for noise quality, so I just swapped them with the Noctua fans I was originally going to use as case fans. Honestly, could've avoided this though by getting the Phantom Spirit Evo, the fans on that one aren't annoying from what I can tell, and you still get one of the best heatsinks on the market, especially when you consider the price.",
      "Great temps. The giant black block of metal looks great in my build.",
      "The Peerless Assassin has a combination of size, thermal performance, and price that few other coolers can match. It is well built, well packaged, and easy to install. The included fans are quiet but not quiet enough for my satisfaction, so I replaced them with Noctua fans.",
      "Looks great in my build, and lots of people are talking about the Peerless Assassin for a good reason. It's cheap and does an extremely good job of keeping your CPU cool. I don't have a very hot CPU, but this just means I can keep the fans on this around 15-25% RPM and have an ice cold CPU with no audible fans."

Installation was easier than the wraith cooler my CPU came with. the RBG is ok for the price point, you are limited to your MOBO RGB software. the paste it comes with is kinda terrible, as in it's temps are reaching stock cooler levels, so I'm using Arctic MX-6 on it right now.\nAlso, if you buy from PCCASEGEAR you get free shipping AND free gummy bears in the package!",

      "Very good cooler, knocked off a star because mounting on Intel LGA1700 and L1851 systems is rather tedious and not properly instructed. In fact, there's no instructions in the box at all and the instructions on their site and in their videos leaves out crucial details.\nNonetheless, it keeps my 12900K idling at ambient temperatures.",
      "It does his job, keeps the Ryzen 7 9700X under 45 °C idle and never above 75 even when gaming.\nFixing the pump on the CPU was as painful as it gets!!\nUpdate: just a note for who wants to use this AIO, it is quite thick, and since the pipe connectors are just a tiny bit (sub 1mm) larger than the radiator, if your case has exactly the 280mm of space for it, you might struggle to force it into position. I certainly had to apply some extra pressure to fit it in position in TheTower 200.",
      "Really nice AIO for the money, I got this on sale as well. I chose the non RGB version for simplicity and better cable management. I am running it without the included VRM fan cap as it's in an SFF case and my motherboard already has a VRM fan. I like that they provide the option to control the pump and fans with a single cable or a split cable. Mounting it is pretty straightforward, to get the second screw into the CPU brackets you need to press quite hard but it's not too bad. I do wish the AIO tubes were able to rotate more at the CPU block so it would fit better in my use case. The pump is quiet enough for me and performs well even running at a constant 40%. I replaced the stock fans with some Noctua NF-A14s I had from my previous build. The included thermal paste has enough for 3-4 remounts which is nice. The screws that mount the rad to your case or bracket will poke into the rad fins and deform them, as long as you don't hit the water passages this seems fine",
      "Considering that I had to remove one of the fans on the radiator to fit it in my system, and it still keeps CPU temps good, I have to commend this AIO's capability.",
      "I have yet to see a comfortable mounting process for any cooler.\nAside from that, this essentially does everything I could ask for. Can be decently silent and cools my 7950X3D just fine.",
      "Not a lot of bells and whistles - the radiator is very thick and the fan is simple. Which, doesn't feel like a super high quality piece but at the same time, keeping these things simple makes them more robust. So far it's doing a great job cooling.",
      "Honestly, the new budget GOAT for AIOs. Stupid quiet for how much cooling you get, and was a breeze to install on Intel. Not seeing anything higher than 80C, even on CPU intensive games like BG3. I love the look of the block, and the no RGB is a plus for me.\nGot it on sale during the Arctic Bday sale, but I'd probably buy it again for updating another build."

The LCD screen is amazing and I would recommend it if trying to save some money if you are not going for the elite version. It runs super quiet and it is a very high quality aio. Only difference compared to the elite is the screen but if that doesnt bother you, go for this one, it will do the job very well.",
      "So far I've run it for a month or so on my Ryzen 9 1900X3D and have had 0 issues with cooling. Peak temps I've seen it reach are 72 C and that's under extreme load with reletively high ambiant temps. I usually idle somewhere in the 43-48 C range. The front display is really nice as I can display my temps on that and the CAM software has a super cool mini mode that I keep open on my 3rd screen so I can always see the system info.",

      "keeps my Ryzen 9 7900X at 80 under load (gaming) pretty quite.",
      "Installing any asetek AIO is always a little sketchy, but otherwise as a cooler this is excellent. Included fans are fair, and pump remains inaudible at lower speeds. The screen has fairly limited functionality, and CAM considers average core temp CPU temp, which is misleading and not very useful. The major downside is having to use CAM, horrible piece of software lacking basic functionality. Also fairly expensive for a basic 360 AIO.",
      "My NZXT Kraken 360: Ice-cold temps and sweet, sweet RGB! This AIO has my CPU chillin' like a penguin on vacation. Fans are whisper-quiet, and NZXT CAM makes tweaking colors and speeds a breeze. If you want a cooler that's both frosty AND flashy, look no further!",
      "A simple and quiet RGB AIO cooler, it's easily able to cool down my CPU with anything that comes at it. With the software that support the cooler, NZXT CAM, you're able to customize the RGB lighting, fan speed, and see the temp of components with its monitoring system. Installing it was a breeze with its easy to follow instructions manual. If you're looking for a visual appealing but also significantly cooling AIO without breaking the bank to much, I would highly recommend this as a option.",

      "4.5 stars.\nI'd give it 5 stars for everything from looks to build quality to raw performance. I'm glad they launched this variant - I really wanted to try a Noctua cooler but the brown color was simply not for me.\nHalf a star goes off for mounting. Mounting is otherwise quite easy, especially on AMD boards where you don't have to install a backplate yourself. But the spring-tensioned screws have a tendency of unbalancing the cooler when you are tightening them and it's not trivial to know if the screw is properly aligned with the bracket.\nOtherwise quite happy with the cooler. Keeps my 5600X at 66C, even in Linpack Xtreme.",

There is just barelyyyy enough room to fit my RAM under this cooler, but fortunately it works. Also, After a year of use, the fans do hum pretty loud at a low rpm. It is bearable though.",
      "Great cooler keeps my CPU at 80-85 I bought thinking it had rgb but it didn't which is fine",
      "Nice and chilly, especially with noctua fans.",
      "Solid cooler, looks amazing. Temps are around 60 Celsius maximum.",
      "A clean air cooler capable of handling high-end CPUs. When I attempted to install it in another build, I encountered an issue where every time I managed to screw one side onto its base, the other side immediately lifted up. I returned it and was informed that the cooler has a spring-loaded mechanism. So, I decided to give it another try in this build. It turned out to be easier than I had anticipated; it simply requires a bit of pressure after screwing in the first screw.\nI would have deducted 1 star because of the uncomfortable installation; however, upon realizing that this cooler effectively cooled the CPU, maintaining a maximum temperature of 70 degrees (no overclocking), I decided not to deduct any stars. This cooler rivals the Noctua NH-D15.",
      "The price is amazing for what you get and it looks amazing. My 12700k stays quite cool. At 120w it sits at 65 to 70c on the stock fan curves",
      "Great cooling not too loud.",
      "Great air cooler for my CPU. That's all I can say, honestly. It came with its own thermal paste, but I opted to ignore that in favor of the paste underneath."

      "Quiet, and works well in my Meshify 2 Compact case, but having said that it's quite large. It seems to be effective and keeps my i7-14700K cpu temps under control. The pipes carrying the coolant are quite stiff and difficult to bend without kinking, so if you need these to be flexible you may want to think carefully, or use a larger case than the one I have. Overall, very happy with the cooler, and it's a quality, well engineered product.",
      "Outstanding AIO - keeps my SFF build very cool with some custom 20mm fans. Only dinged one star for the insanely difficult install process. Had to literally put my body weight onto it to keep it pinned flat enough to the CPU for both \"flaps\" of metal to be screwable into the motherboard frame.",

      "Looks stunning, it's completely silent on idle and very quiet on load. This is a PC component I will use for all my future builds until I die. Best PC purchase I've ever made.",
      "It can be a bit loud when the fans are going at full speed, for the CPU in the build I would recommend adjusting the fan curve as the CPU never gets too warm. I don't know if it is because of the thermal paste, the cooler or both but the results are good and most of the time I have a silent computer.",
      "Runs quiet compared to the other fans in the case and keeps the cpu cool during gaming.",
      "Hugemongous cooler of insane sizeability. It barely fits the S340, but does so with enough millimeters for me to add a little custom faceplate to hide the heatsink pipes and show off the lovely metal Noctua decal. The sleek Chromax design is gorgeous and highly effective. If you need less hugeness, the NH-U9S is also fantastic. You may need to look for lower-profile RAM modules depending on your motherboard's layout.",
      "Overpriced for what it is but I couldn't bring myself to dock a star. Silent even under the heaviest loads i use it at, keeps the CPU nice and cool, and comes with classic Noctua reliability, compatibility, and customer service. Also, i got mine for like $130 (the current display price is from MemoryC which is like $100 more expensive)",
      "Super quiet even when running at 100% percent, which I love.",
      "I'll say for my use case, this works great. Anything heavier and you'll need a big AIO to keep up with this chip. Noctua's guidance on this on their website is misleading, which is why I'm taking off a star. It's whisper quiet, though, and was a tactile pleasure to work with getting it installed. No clearance issues whatsoever.",
      "I fully intend to stay air cooled for the foreseeable future so I didn’t want to cheap out. Noise was a priority here so I spent a little extra for the best. The d15 was another option but seeing as the u12a performs very closely with less of a footprint I opted for the smaller option. I had intention to vertically mount my gpu and I wanted as much space as possible. It performs amazing and stays quiet. I never need to run the fans above 50%. They normally hover between 10%-30%. Practically silent. Also I went chromax black because: what would Batman do. 10/10",
      "Running great so far, haven’t optimized fan profiles but was idle with my 7800X3D at 29 C. Was gaming into the high 50s touched lows 60s for a bit but didn’t have air condition on in house. Cracked open the door into the storage closet and temps dropped back down into 50s again playing Baulder’s Gate 3 and Doom all ultra maxed out 1440p. I will have to optimize the fan profiles for the cpu fans and rest of case. But looks amazing so far. I am just wondering if it will match or beat my old Thermaltake Frio OCK I had. That thing would keep my 4960X at a gaming temp of mid 40s. I could idle at 23C. Will need to turn on air condition in house as it wasn’t on either. Just was ambient temp.\nI will post updates and bench’s once I get everything optimized in the coming weeks. Also, no tweaks or undercooking done to 7800X3D yet. Have to get baselines first then go from there. Beautiful look with other black Noctua case fans, really slick and very impressive.\nUpdate: I have had short 5 second or so spikes in into the high low 70s, however this was a result of me having all the doors closed in an enclose room. When I have both doors open both 7800x3d and the 7900 xt stay in the mid 60s. Most games gaming in 1440 p stay in the 60-65 degree Celsius range. When I download games from steam the cpu will spike to 70C under load downloading games blazing fast. I still have games with central ac on. So I will likely post an update during dog days of summer. As soon as the game exits temps come down immediately back to idle temps.",
      "Amazing cooler, which is to be expected from Noctua. Practically silent at idle and during gaming. Probably a bit overkill for my CPU, but its great to have that thermal headroom. The included NF-A12x25 perform flawlessly and are the quietest fans I've ever used."

I had just a bit of trouble mounting it, but nothing was damaged and just took me a minute to realize I was screwing one side in to far and needing to ease both screws in simultaneously for them to fit in.\nIt does have a bit of noise, not whisper quiet or anything, but given the price that doesn't bother me. I can't hear it over my music//game sessions (which I dont blast or anything.)",
      "The price for performance on this cooler is insane, the fans it comes with are pretty decent too but the pipes are a bit stiff compared to other AIOs, installation in the case was easy but on the CPU itself was a pain in the ***.",
      "Great value CPU cooler the only 2 things I don't like is I couldn't put the radiator in the orientation i wanted to put it in because the tubes wouldn't bend at all and the box came pretty banged up other than that build quality was good."

      "He keeps cool my CPU as he could, but i think it's a little bit weak for the 7600X (even with the NOCTUA fan duct kit https://noctua.at/en/na-fd1). I'll test the THERMALRIGHT AXP120-X67 (67MM) who seems clearly better with the 7600x based on caselabs's review. (https://www.caselabs.org/coolers/low-profile-coolers)",
      "This little thing cools my Ryzen 5 7600 (65 watts) without any issue when idle. Thanks to the fan curve that I configured, it spins up its fan quickly when the CPU gets a bit hot (70-80 degrees), but just as quickly shuts up again.\nDue to the size its not the quietest part, but the sound it makes is predictable and not annoying in frequency or sound color."

      "This cooler is great for the price you pay.T he temps on my cpu vary based on the temp of my house, but even under a cinebench 30 minute test, my cpu never went above 76c, however it never gets that hot when gaming. Keep in mind I do have a -28mv offset, so it would probaly hit 80c without the undervolt. The stock fan is pretty good quality, and rather quiet, even at full speed. It comes with another fan bracket so you could have a push pull set up on the cooler. I tested this with one of my case fans, but it didn't change the max temp under load. Overall this is a great cpu cooler that can handle up to 220w, which is great because my cpu pulls around 150 watts at full load.",
      "A cheap quiet cooler. Haven’t had any problems and was very easy to install.",
      "A good cooler, enough to cool a Ryzen 7 5700X with little difficulty. The included fan is a very quiet one and it includes brackets to attach another one.",
      "Quiet Cheap Does what it supposed too nothing extra but keeps a 65 watt tdp cpu chilly🥶",
      "Good cooler, very quiet, cools an i3-12100F great, 20°c idle, ~65°c under load."

      "I trust Noctua coolers. I've used this model more than once in SFF builds. Silent and effective at stock CPU speeds. Check Noctua's website for compatibility.\nThe Noctua mounting system is infinitely better than the pins on Intel's stock fans.\nI originally had this 9 cm CPU fan in a mini-ITX build. It works fine in this build, but I still might have chosen Noctua's low-height NH-D12L if I were starting from scratch. The 12 cm cooler has over 68% more cooling power according to Noctua.",

      "awesome pretty (everything except the fan) and small (perfect for my small form factor case) air cooler. at one point i'm probably going to exchange the ugly noctua fan with a white one (because my build is mostly white and I dislike the color). don't hear the fan, because if system ramps up, case fans are always louder.",
      "Quality unit as always. Handled cooling 110 watts that my MB reported the 12600K was using, at less than full fan speed.",
      "This cooler simply shocked me with how effective it is, given its size. With 2 fans on it, I genuinely believe that it could easily cool even the most powerful of CPU's. This is coming from someone that's a bit of a cooling & silence enthusiast, so trust me, this is simply an awesome little cooler. Unlike some of the larger or even giant air coolers, this cooler also doesn't look like it's going to disform your motherboard over an extended period of time.",

      "keeps the cpu temps low enough. it also came with thermal paste so pretty nice.",
      "It's actually quite simple to put together and it's a really good cooler, but my biggest (and only) complaint is how the fan attaches. The fan attaches to the heat sink with these wire brackets. They don't feel very sturdy, they're somewhat awkward to attach to the fan, and when attaching to the heat sink, you just press them into the sides and that's supposed to keep it there.",
      "This is an RGB (and better optimized) variant of the once \"hyper\" popular Hyper 212 (see what I did there? I'm so funny). It cools quite well and comes with a thermal paste tube, and clips to put on another fan if I need to. 15 dollars is well worth it for this",

Also, the mounting mechanism definitely takes off a star. I get the price, but the 'stock cooler' type of clips shouldn't be used for anything above $15 or $20.",

It also does not take a lot of room so it was not in the way when connecting power cables to motherboard.",

      "Super cute, I love the look, extremely silent! The initial one I purchased from Newegg had a slight noise to it. Sounded like there was a rock stuck in the pump. I went to BestBuy, talked to GeekSquad and they advised it wasn't supposed to sound like that, and that it was defective, so I returned it back to Newegg and purchased the same model in store. Newegg refunded without a problem, and the new one sounds as intended, quiet! Upon researching the noise, others were saying to shake it or turn it upside down because of bubbles, and that is not the case. Just submit a warranty claim as the issue is the reason of being defective. Overall, the screen is beautiful and has a rich feel to it. The RBG version of this cooler, the fans looked and felt extremely cheap. This is the better version and is worth the price!",
      "The main reason for buying this cooler is the screen, you can get same results with cheaper coolers, this one works great btw",
      "Always been a fan of NZXT products. When I saw there was a newer version of the Kraken, I knew it wouldn't disappoint. The screen looks amazing, the noise is minimal, and my 9800X3D is happy.",
      "The Kraken Elite 360mm AIO has been an excellent cooler for my Ryzen 9 9950X3D, keeping temps low even under heavy loads. Installation was straightforward, and the adjustable pump orientation made it easy to fit into my build. The IPS LCD screen is a nice touch, allowing for custom displays and real-time system monitoring.\nCooling performance is top-notch, with the static pressure fans providing great airflow while staying quiet. The CAM software integration makes it easy to adjust fan curves and monitor temps. Overall, it’s a reliable and stylish AIO that performs as great as it looks.",
      "Price might drive you away but this cpu cooler has managed to be my favorite part out of all the others despite the fact that it wasn't my initial choice for cpu cooling. I went with this instead of the iCUE H150i ELITE LCD but could have probably went with the non elite or older elite version. Display is awesome, fans are clean, sleek and having no RGB makes it look nicer imo. The NZXT CAM software is really nice and the customization and tweaking options are diverse. Install was fairly easy too with all the required cables being nicely sleeved.",
      "This Kraken Elite 360 has done a great job so far of keeping my i7-14700k cool. Idle temp is around 30-32 C, and under load it usually stays around 65 C or lower. The configurable circular screen is great. Two complaints though: the LED ring is not diffused very well, making individual LEDs visible; also, the sleeves on the tubes are not very smooth and get crimped easily.",
      "Good performance with fans at lower rpm. However the data cable moved to rad outlet is not fully sheathed, which takes away from the otherwise clean look.",
      "Beauty of an AIO. Works great cooling a 9800x3d. Pumps relatively quiet. I LIED. The pump failed on me, started making a grinding noise. The noise only seems to disappear when at 100%... only good thing left is the display 😔"

It not only cools well but additionally it looks sleek and modern, all while operating quietly. Would recommend.",

What stands out for this AIO compared to the others in the market is that this is serviceable. Meaning bequiet! provides coolant to be changed out or added when it is time. Super neat and useful. Would recommend on any future builds."

      "Very cool AIO\nOverkill really, but for top-end chips it helps push higher clocks on sustained loads even as you reach 95 degrees (the norm for AM5 chips at least). Worth setting up push-pull if you have a case large enough for it.\nNot to mention excellent value too... if you are looking for pure performance this is a no-brainer.",
      "Removing one star for it's size. Adding one star for it's size. That thing is MASSIVE. I should not have bought it because it is literally OP for the little ecologist 7800x3D",
      "Pros:\n38mm thick radiator provides more cooling then standard thickness radiators\nVRM fan is actually effective\nThe leaf spring on the pump provides nice pressure on the CPU\nComes with a contact frame for Intel Chips\nComes with offset bracket mount for AM5 chips\nThe tubes are nice and long, allowing this to be mounted to the top or side of a case\nCons:\nThe pump can be a pain to get mounted into the AM5 offset bracket mount due to the leaf spring\nOn the underside of the brackets for AM5 chips are tiny paper thin nuts stamped/formed into the metal of the bracket. If you tighten down the pump to much or to hard it will break those nuts and allow them to spin freely, making it impossible to get the pump off without undoing the entire bracket system. (I had to buy another one of these because of that issue)\nMinor Grievances:\nThe pump and hoses coming from it may have clearance issues with certain motherboards (Ex. ASUS X870E HERO and it's top most M.2 Heatsink)\nThe cables for the fans and the RGB run up one of the hoses and connect to the included RGB fans. If you are using different fans these cables may be redundant and are very hard to hide.\nThe tubes used are hard and don't like to bend a lot\nThe included cables for the RGB on the VRM header and to power the pump and fans are long making cable management a bit difficult\nFinal Thoughts:\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants a 420mm AIO liquid cooler for their system. Arctic makes some very nice liquid coolers with excellent cooling to price performance. The leaf spring design for the Liquid Freezer III series is nice but also a pain, especially if you are on an AM5 chip. The inclusion of a contact frame for Intel chips is a nice touch from Arctic. The offset brackets for AM5 chips could use a revision. As mentioned above, there are tiny paper thin nuts on the underside of the bracket where the pump screws into. If you screw down the pump to tight or to hard (which is easy to do because of the leaf spring used), those tiny nuts will break and spin freely. Which makes it impossible to get the pump off and you will have to undo the entire bracket system to get the pump off. I had this happen to the first one I bought and I had to buy a new one.",
      "Great cooler, working well so far.",
      "Does not handle quick cpu temp fluctuations from sudden loads very well, will jump from 40c to low 50c quickly. But under extended heavy loads it has never allowed the 7600X3D to get over 77c. The removable pump fan is an awesome feature for easy of installation and a fun party trick to just rip a part out of your machine. RGB works and looks good, fans work great and are relatively quiet.\n4 stars because this thing is a bear and a half to mount properly while solo. The screws on the mounting hardware are a pain to get started, you need enough force to bend the spring steel tension plate to get the screws started, but not so much that you cause thermal paste to thin out on the cpu... A different mount solution or an installation aid would be much appreciated in future releases.",
      "Massive cooler - one of the best performance to price cooler. Has RGB on the cooler mount. Has integrated VRM cooling fan. Multiple cable options available for individual fan/radiator pump control. Delivers amazing cooling performance within reasonable noise limits. Its a steal under 100 quid.",
      "I've used Arctic Liquid Freezer AIOs in a few builds. Generally they are one of the best, if not the best performing AIOs on the market with the others being Lian Li GA II Trinity and EKWB EK-Nucleus. Unfortunately EK seems to be on the economic ropes right now and may not survive. Some YouTube tech channels have cut ties with them due to their business practices. Lian Li has always been good, their RMA and customer support has been great, although I have had two of their AIOs fail on me. So, that leaves Arctic as the most, at this point, reliable. This model is an improved model for them. I think it is a better aesthetic design and easy to install. It's also inexpensive relative to other AIOs.\nFor me, also, they are one of the few companies offering a 420mm radiator. So, that was really the deciding factor.",

      "Amazing CPU cooler for the price. Easy upgrade by buying two nicer fans and attaching them with clips. Keeps temps wicked cool. I have not went a degree over 75C whilst playing games",
      "Installing this was the hardest. After you do that you’ll find yourself satisfied with the purchase. It’s very quiet and the rgb itself is awesome.",
      "Was a bit dubious if this could cool an 11th gen i7 but it's going strong do far. Haven't seen the temps above 65 Celsius while playing Witcher 3 GOTY with RT ultra at 1440P. Incredibly impressed with the value of this cooler .",
      "The RGB fan doesnt wanna work anymore idk dont care as a cooler its ok but overpriced in todays market",
      "Good performance, but can be a pain to install. Recommend Noctua for an easier install, or a 240mm AIO.",
      "Looks great and does a great job at keeping temperatures cooler in comparison to a stock cooler. Great value for money, just about fits in this configuration with a bit of room to spare between the fan and RAM (enough room to take fan on/off).",
      "RGB options are limited for its price for example the lack of orange and pink but other than that it's not noisy and perfectly servicable.",
      "More than enough for my 10700 keeping temps below 70 under full load. Has nice rgb and runs quietly. It would have been nice to have been able to overclock my CPU since there is a sizeable amount of headroom .",
      "Cools my CPU very nicely, keeping it at 38°C at idle and under 80°C at full load. Only issues were it was pretty hard, but not impossible, to screw into its AM4 mounting bracket, but that could just be because it was my first time building a PC. I accidentally dropped a screw onto the top of my CPU and made a dint while trying to install the cooler, but that's entirely my fault xD. I also don't think I knew the difference between RGB and A-RGB at the time of building the PC, so I was confused as to why this cooler could only display one colour at a time whilst the Cooler Master Sickleflow case fans could do rainbow swirls. I set it to be purple after the build as it matches rainbow colours the best. This was, again, my fault. But yeah the installation process could've been easier.",
      "Got it for 15 bucks, pretty good at that price even though I didn't really need it it makes the whole build look a bit better and stay a bit cooler. Keeps my 12100f about 20c cooler than the stock cooler. Cooler is worth it if you can get it for like 20-25 bucks but its current price isn't great. The only thing I don't really like about is the rgb on the fan."

Additionally, I think the L12 looks immaculate aesthetically.",

Mine arrived with some lightly bent fins and what looked like surface wear on the leading edges where the fan and clips had vibrated and shifted against the surface. Very tight memory clearance, stick to memory that has no extra frills and just a low profile heat spreader.",
      "It's still a great cooler all in all, but just barely handles modern high-end Intel CPUs. It was pretty good for my 12600K and I hoped to be able to keep it for the 13700K upgrade, but it struggled a little. It was fine on most gaming scenarios but let the 13700K throttle on intensive CPU loads.\nI don't think it's a great option for modern builds anymore. Unless you can find it really cheap, there are other options with comparable performance for much better prices (aka Thermal Right's Peerless Assassin).\nIf you still want to go high-end, I'd recommend stepping up to Arctic's Liquid Freezer III 360 AIO, which will give you the best thermal performance in the market as of Apr/2024 for not too much more money.",
      "I read so many reviews saying this cooler is hell to setup, but I must say it was pretty easy, and I love that it came with a magnet-tip screw-driver. It tames my CPU pretty well, max 90 degrees Celsius so far that I've seen under heavy gaming load, it's also pretty quiet.",
      "Overkill for my i5 13600k but that just means my CPU will last forever. Keeps temps down while being super quiet. be quite's fans are a marvel of engineering.",
      "Does the job well even on a 7950X3D despite being an air cooler, but I'm not planning on OC'ing. Mounting/installation was simple, no idea why so many people hate on this cooler for that reason."

The temps are not as good as an AIO (44C idle, 85C load), however its just metal and it cant break.\nI know Thermalright Assasin is probably just as good, but I find that cooler very unpleasing to look at...",

      "I like big CPU air coolers and I cannot lie...\nThis was always my dream cooler, and I finally just grabbed it!\nIMHO the most sexy air cooler to date, with a stylish industrial design. The coating is perfectly applied, but that is to be expected by Noctua, no less.\nIt cools the 7800X3D like a champ with the included AM5 offset mounting brackets, what more can you say?"

      "-was super easy to set up even as a PC building noob\n-love the screen even though it's not the elite version, as long as you pick pictures with black backround you can't tell from most angles that it's a square\n-also great cooling performance so far",
      "Absolutely amazing CPU cooler, the LCD screen is so cool as I can get GIFs, YT vids and stats on my parts on it. It also cools my CPU really well when its under pressure. Also nice that it came with thermal paste pre-installed. Would recommend for anyone wanting an AIO, although it is on the pricy side.",
      "I've always wanted this cooler from when I first saw it because of the LCD on it, and of course it requires the NZXT CAM software to make it run and usable. Even the fans looked great with RGB. However, when building, I realized that I would be using 2 different software to control the RGB's as you will find out more in the description of the build.",
      "Quite expensive, however I got a good deal on Black Friday. My cpu has never gone above 65 degrees and the screen is very cool.",
      "Has an excellent LCD. They were mounted on a side mount where fans are initially higher than the CPU on the case. The manual that this comes with was labeled for the 240 Kraken RGB but included instructions for a 360, which was very frustrating as a first-time builder trying to figure out what cords needed to go where & precisely what I needed to do—trying to decide what did or didn't apply to me, which lead to very annoying over complication & self-doubt, and then unplugged cables. It's annoying. It keeps it cool, though!"

      "Price was a little high, the 4 double sided screws can be a little tricky, it provides exceptional performances, runs quiet, AIO and RGB look amazing.\nThe Kraken elite was a good pick for the CPU that I bought. It was a little pricey compared to most other cpu coolers, but I couldn't get my hands on the Arctic II unfortunately, so I settled for good performance for a hefty price. First off, it looks great, it doesn't run super loud, and when I need it to kick on and cool off my Ryzen 9 7950x when it reaches those high temps, it does so. The cable management for it was pretty easy, at least with this version, there's not so many cables that are kind of in the way, it looks very neat and the whole thing was easy to put together with the single case fan. There was a 3 prong cable that came off of the CPU cooler that I didn't end up hooking into anything, and it still runs fine.\nIt had an Intel and AMD version for the AIO to connect to your motherboard. It came already installed with the Intel bracket, I had to switch it out for the AMD bracket and make sure to be careful not to bump into the Pre-applied thermal paste. It's nice that they include both versions and they are very easy to switch out. I will say 4 screws are double sided for connecting to the motherboard and at first glance they have the same thread but they do not, make sure you install it correctly. The pre-applied thermal paste on the bottom of the AIO was also super nice, you just have to be careful not to bump into it at all when you set it down in your CPU and let it go. And the AIO itself is beautiful, the customization is awesome, people give NZXT a real hard time with their software but I think if you understand computer software, it's not that hard.",
      "A little pricey but went with NZXT on a lot of the computer components so felt necessary to get the Kraken Elite. Worth the price though this cooler is beautiful and powerful.",
      "Pros: Big and beautiful display with a lot of customization options. The cordless design on the pump looks very clean. The Kraken Elite V2 also has great performance keeping my 13900K ~8c cooler than my previous Corsair H150i Elite AIO under stress testing.\nCons: The pump has a rattle/grinding sound when set to less than 40% speed (~1900rpm or less). I never have my pump set that low so it's not much of an issue, but I have read it's pretty common, so something to keep in mind.",
      "The 2.7 inch LCD screen is awesome with gif feature. It has some coil whine under load, but acceptable."

      "Really good cooling performance, cheap, and comes in white. AIOs do look better, but the potential leakage scares me, and they are so much more expensive for only slightly cooler temps. If you are on the AM5, the mounting kit seems to sometimes come with red mounts or black/grey mounts. Mine came with red ones so I ended up painting them."

      "Works well and looks great, the fan cables are all long though so expect a lot of wiring, but for the price you can't complain.",
      "Surprisingly quiet at 6k RPM. Cools my 14900K without any issues. Extremely good value proposition. The fans are dookie though."
