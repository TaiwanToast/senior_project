      "it's a Blu-ray disk reader.",
      "I've had bad luck with LG in the past with a Blu-ray player, but this one is holding up well so far and it's priced very well for an internal Blu-ray drive. As another reviewer mentioned, it makes a click-buzz sound on startup, reminiscent of old PCs from the '90s and early 2000s, but besides that, I found it very quiet and making almost no vibration, even when with high disc spin speeds (though part of it may also be due to the case).",
      "Not too many ppl use optical drives anymore, I bought this over 8 years ago and it still works like new. Use it to rip and play all my DVDs",

      "I actually like how this is put together. It's the one 5.25\" addon I have hooked up.",
      "Works out of the box with no setup or bloatware. Blu-Rays require extra libraries, but that's a software problem that goes outside the scope of this review; bottom line is, it does what it needs to.",
      "Cheapest and best Blu-ray disc bay I could find at the time.\nIt burns and reads all formats (cd, DVD, Blu-ray) works fine based on my testing, the only complaint I have is that it's a bit stiff and rough when opening and closing, so make sure your discs are in completely and correctly!",
      "Good price and good performance. I use it almost everyday with working with CD's.",
      "Works fine. Makes a charming click-buzz on startup, I love it.",

It does need the right software but it does do those things.\nMy wife doesn't particularly need this but even long after my wife upgrades to a completely new computer in the future, I can instead use the computer as a media center for my blu-rays, DVDs, and emulated gaming thanks to this thing.\nWorks as advertised.",
      "I don't think you really need a disc drive in your pc nowadays, and there are some decent usb externals that probably do the job. I've never had a problem with this one though, and its been a little above-average at reading some 'rough' discs that other readers had trouble with.\nI have a large collection of old discs full of games, apps, music and whatever kicking around, and its nice to be able to plug them in, and copy what I want to save.",
      "Does what it's supposed to...\nThough, adding to that: \"Playing BluRay Movies\" is not something it's supposed to do sadly (which was my mistake).\nIt can write to BluRay storage media (as in discs), but it doesn't magically come with the software and encoders (or whatever they're called) to read the BluRay movies. Blame DMCA and the greedy film industry for trying to undo as much of the Betamax case ruling as possible in the name of \"fighting Piracy\".\nSo if you ever see \"DVD on BluRay\", it'll now make sense to you.",

      "It's a great Bluray/DVD/CD writer. I bought it because of its low price. I was surprised that it performed so well! I've burned about 10 Bluray discs already and I encountered no issues at all. All my writes were perfect! It's a pretty fast writer too. I've also used it to write DVDs. Works great as well! This can also write on LTH Bluray Discs, which are the cheaper, more affordable Bluray discs. Just take note that some Bluray players are unable to read LTH Bluray discs. This optical drive is also a quiet drive. I noticed that the noise it generates is coming from the discs being used. Some discs seem to be noisier than others. So far all of my discs I've burned are quiet. I would highly recommend this Optical drive due to its capabilities and low price.",

Some Krylon and masking tape saved the day. Obviously this voids the warranty, but I think you'll agree it's worth it."

But it can read/write/rr M-Discs so that’s a plus. Just don’t get the drive with the software bundle!",

      "I'd imagine this would be great at playing Blu-rays. I say I imagine, because due to some proprietary DRM ******** called the Protected Audio/Video Pipeline that all Blu-rays require for playback on PC, it's completely impossible to directly play back Blu-rays unless you are using an Intel CPU with integrated graphics. If you have an Intel F-series or an AMD CPU, these TV/film studios could not care less about you as the customer. Because of this, I unfortunately wasted money buying this thing, as I myself have a Ryzen 9 5900X.\nBut despite all that said, this drive is super quiet in operation and makes no vibrations, making it pretty much perfect for watching DVDs or playing back CDs, even in a relatively quiet room. It's also as good of a burner/ripper as it gets--and amusingly, Blu-ray rippers still work despite my predicament, meaning that in a hilariously ironic twist, this DRM was there to stop me from doing \"illegal\" things to the discs has instead forced me to.\nAnyway, if you're running any AMD or Intel F-series CPU, then don't buy this if you're looking to watch any movies or TV shows straight off the disc with it. But if you wanna burn your own BD-Rs, or rip those aforementioned BDs/UHD-BDs, then go right ahead.",

      "LOL, I bought an optical drive way back in 2013 on my first build. What a rookie move. I barely used the thing, and I bought a blu ray drive specifically to watch movies. Another mistake, since you have to purchase driver software for exorbitant rates to even run a blu ray disc. It's a racket and I surely won't be buying another. I took it out of the case for a few years, but I put it in since I wasn't using it for anything else. It's still in the case, collecting dust.",
      "Not alot to say about this. It is fairly noisy when the disk is first inserted but does quiet down after. It all works fine so i'm happy with this.",
      "Great piece of kit fast burning, fast reading however the drive is loud and everyone is aware when it spins up."

Perhaps its some kind of power saving \"E-Green\" thing on the front of the drive? Its a great value, but you get what you pay for.",

      "Cheap, but sturdy. In retrospect, I have a TON of these laying around collecting dust. Ordering a new one was pointless. If anything I should have ordered a bluray drive instead, as my only current bluray option is a Playstation that my GF uses constantly.\nLG is a good brand. I've never had one go out on me. If you need a disc drive for whatever reason, they're acceptable. Mine was necessary because I had drivers to install to get internet access to install drivers for the rest of the PC. If you already have a PC, you can get the drivers on a thumb drive and use that to transfer them. If you don't have a PC, a disc drive is actually quite handy for getting started."

      "It's an optical drive. I am not sure many of the current generation builders know what \"CD's\" are, but back in the late 80's and early 90's they were huge. With the adoption of the personal PC you could transfer the audio tracks from these CD's and put them on your Hard Drive. Your parents would hate you for filling up their 500MB hard drive with a half dozen CDs. Yes I am a dinosaur. Yes I still like having an optical. There is a rare occasion I will put in a movie that I don't have a digital code too."

      "Don't use it anymore lol.",
      "For when you absolutely cannot avoid using an optical drive. Build quality is okay (could be better), functionality and compatibility has been fine, haven't had any major problems. For the price, it's not a bad deal.",
      "The only reason why this loses a star is because of the lack of native blu-ray codec support. Otherwise, it was a decision that I made to keep this drive, and utilize it.",
      "I wanted to add a cheap but quality DVD/CD writer. I have used Samsung drives in the past and never had any issues. Samsung offers a good warranty.",
      "I was a little worried this wouldn't function correctly as it sounded like something in it was rattling when I got it in the mail, but after powering up for the first time it worked perfectly and exceeded my expectations. It is capable of reading and writing all but blu-ray disk media and it is as fast as a whip for its price. Had no qualms installing all my older disk-based games and the drivers disks for the hardware were installed in a flash. It blends in very well with the case too, adding a nice touch to the aesthetic of the front. My only complaint is that it is nosier than expected, but its still quiet enough for the speed it runs at.",
      "Works very well, but seems rather loud when it spools up."
