      "Good airflow and cable mgmt. This case is a good value for the price. Do its job well.",
      "Quite easy to build in",
      "Amazing looking case, fits all of my components like a glove. It was hard getting the graphics card in because the cooler would bump into the card when i put it in. the removeable filters on it work great. No dust got into the case.",
      "Excellent Case. Has everything you need for cable management due to its great design. Airflow is great, keeping fresh cool air flowing into the case.",
      "Excellent Case. - Looks nice, tinted glass side is solid when system is unlit, and clear when illuminated from inside. - Easy cable management (but a bit crowded with cable extentions). - Simple maintenance, panels are easy to open and clean. - Great air intake through the front, which is expected for a case named \"Airflow\". - Extension slots for vertical mounting and lots of normal ones.",
      "While the case is very sleek, the front port options leave a lot to be desired at the normal price. I'm sure more people would want an extra USB port instead of a reset button. In addition, the cable management felt a bit tight for my comfort, as there weren't many options for the wires to go through. While cable management is not too much of a negative for me, extra USB ports are important enough for me to remove a star. Otherwise, very good case.",
      "Good quality case, specially for the price. Airflow is fantastic. Cable management is pretty good and plenty of space to work around for mATX - ATX builds. Sadly there's too few USB ports in the front.",
      "Amazing case! it was really easy to build in and cable management was easy too. I can see why the 4000D is so popular.",
      "Good case. It was not the best looking, but I was going for pure performance. Great airflow and size.",
      "Had little problems with the cable management and putting everything in place. Looks nice even without any lighting and the airflow is top notch. Just get some more fans if you feel two aren't enough."

      "Exceptional pc case, 3 pre installed fans, plenty of room for cable management, cables are daisy chain able with excellent air flow. Absolute worth the 78 aud.",
      "This case looks nice and feels nice to build in. For a $55(bought for 7999¥ at a local store) case that comes with rubber grommets on cutouts, plenty of cable management options in the back and nice looking glass, this is an ABSOLUTE STEAL. Cooling out the box is great as well. Only problem is if you want matching fans, Montech does not sell any reverse GF120 fans so RIP if you want all matching fans.\nWill definitely buy another one of these case in the Japan exclusive pastel colors.",
      "Very nice case swapped the fans for 4 black fans",
      "Excellent case for a great price! Nothing feels cheap and it looks great loads of room for larger cards and extra fans",
      "EXTREMELY GOOD BUDGET CASE!!! This is a fantastic fish tank case and I was shocked at how good it was for the price. Only flaw is that the cable management on the back panel is extremely hard due to lack of space but thats more user error.",
      "Comes with fans, great cable management with cable ties, all for about $75 (when i got it)",
      "Incredible case. So much room to work as both glass panels come off very safely and smooth. Case fans are a bit loud but they do their job very well. Building everything and cable-management was extremely easy with this case. Could not recommend more.",
      "This case looks great! It is also easy to build in and comes with 3 extra fans. The airflow is also great which helps keep temps down.",
      "Best £45 case ever made, quality features at such a low price like this rarely happens. Montech never disappoint. The rgb on the preinstalled fans is great too.",
      "Great bang for your buck, came with 3 RGB fans and looks very nice. 4 stars because I had to turn around one of the fans the because it was set to exhaust and was conflicting with my CPU air cooler but other than that great case"

      "This is an excellent budget case! The only things that separate it from cases that cost 3x as much are that the side panels don't come on and off quite as smoothly, and the mesh front panel doesn't have a removable dust filter (the top does). Also, the PCIE slot covers on the back feel a bit flimsy. Otherwise, I can barely tell the difference between this and my Corsair 5000D. It also comes with a million zip ties for cable management, which is nice.",
      "Awesome budget case, I love the look. Was easy to build in, had lots of cable ties for cable management, fits a Corsair Shift PSU.",
      "Can fit up to an ROG Strix 4090!",
      "Easy to build in, good build quality, cheap price",
      "Ample space for cable management in the back, and space for routing RGB and Fan cables in tucked away spots. But dang, that back fan looks really bad. Swapped all fans in the case to the cheapest thermalright RGB fans I could find on Amazon and it looks great! moved the stock 120mm back fan to the metal grate that covers the PSU basement, which pulls air coming in from the bottom 120mm front intake fan and pushes it straight into the graphics card",
      "Good case for the price, probably one of best in its price range (though if you save just a bit more, there are better options).\nhas space for all my stuff and very good to cable manage in, I love I can fit my 5 x 140mm fans, captive screws, nice tempered class design, My temps are pretty good.\nMy only gripe is no dust filter up front but one on the top??\notherwise great case.",
      "Good freaking case, I was about to have the 4000D but my cooler and RAM would have not fit so I went with this one (around the same price) and this is perfect (184mm clearance for the cooler)",
      "Great case",
      "50 dollars for a case is great!\nI would get the pop air for 50$ at the time of review, but this case is awesome"

      "At first, I had a bit of trouble removing the right side panel and accidentally bent the frame because I thought the instructions indicated to angle it all the way down, but I was actually supposed to pull the top ball sockets out and then pull up from the bottom.\nOtherwise, this case has some pretty good airflow and great cable management. I had no issues whatsoever with the cables due to the fact that this is such a spacious case.",
      "Looks good and has good airflow",
      "A pleasure to build in. Massive airflow.",
      "Dream to work within and very pretty. Tons of options to organize cables, although you really have to be careful to plug in the front USB header + any SATA cables into a MB like the Gigabyte Aorus X870 because the GPU will cover it once in place.\nLove the velcro and little hooks pre-installed with lots of places to adhere zip ties.\nOnly two downsides of this case for me is that, for some reason, in an all-white case, the cables for the front IO are black; why not white for consistency? Additionally, I would reduce the size of the bottom area gaps for cables (or use white pass-through plates) because it's so easy to see the cables down there.",
      "airflow 10/10 and with the back making cable management so easy i love it. but the fans it comes with get pretty loud underload and i would have preferred to pay less and get no fans and buy my own but alas. I also have my desk rotated in a way where i have to have the pc backwards to have the glass facing me but that's more my fault.",
      "Great case, easy to build in with lots of room in the back for cables and hubs. Do not regret purchasing, it looks amazing. Airflow is great with my 6 intake 4 exhaust configuration.",
      "one of the best looking fishtank pc cases made with perfect airflow",
      "beautiful case but.... those cables...",
      "Considerably large case, clean and pleasant to build in. Recommended if you're aiming for a clean and aesthetic build.",
      "Looks great, but its massive, heavy and the fans have outdated connectors which dont have headers on my mobo. has pre installed velcro strips and makes cable management really easy, also has all of the front panel connectors grouped up which makes them really easy to plug in."

      "Not a terrible building experience. There was enough room in the back for standard cable management, but I pushed it to its limits because there was no PSU basement, so I put as much as I possibly could back there. The power supply itself had to be mounted strangely, I'm not sure if that was for SFX PSU compatibility, but it was weird. Related pic attached. For $36 though it's great.",

I wish I had just bailed on the build that day and waited for a new case, because I made a split second decision on a new case and it was a rough go putting things in the new one as well.\nIf you get a good piece of acrylic, you'd probably be happy with this case, until you try to clean it. I've heard enough about people cleaning their acrylic side panels and scratching it with a microfiber cloth that I honestly just wouldn't choose this again.",

      "The NZXT H9 Flow has been an awesome case for my build. The dual-chamber design makes cable management super clean, and the airflow is great, especially with all the fan mounting options. It comes with plenty of space for cooling, and my Kraken Elite AIO fits perfectly with no clearance issues.\nThe glass panels show off the build beautifully, and the overall design feels premium. It was easy to work in, with tool-less access and well-placed routing channels. Paired with good fans, thermals stay solid, even with high-end hardware like my Ryzen 9 9950X3D and RTX 5090. If you want a clean, airflow-focused case that looks amazing, the H9 Flow is a fantastic choice.",

      "Big case with good airflow. Only downside was the amount of clearance issues when installing the gpu and aio. It’s also really heavy, so try not to build it somewhere where you have to move it really far.",

      "Really happy with this case. Was lovely to work in and there is a ton of expansion space.",
      "One of my favorite cases of all time. It looks amazing and is easy to work in.",
      "1- (good) There is enough space between the Top mounted Air cooler and the Motherboard to comfortably pass cables back to the PSU (CPU, CPU PUMP, fans, ...).\n2- (good) Apart the two points below (3) and (4), the case is spacious and gives a lot of room to work.\n3- (bad) The space between lateral plate (next to the lateral case fans) of the case and the Mobo is in my opinion very narrow. Yes i could pass trough it the Mobo power cable, Sata and Usb-C cables but without much ease. I think it's a shame if we consider how big the case is.\n4- (bad) The GPU power cable is clamped by the side panel, there is not enough space. Not big deal, the GPU is working but if you have to open the side panel frequently you need to be careful ! Once again, that should not be the case for a big case like this one.\n5- (good) The back of the case gives a lot of space for cable management and SSD/HDD mounting (a rotating panel dedicated to storage units is awesome).\n6- (neutral) Once i mounted the PSU, i found it hard to attach cables into it, so i think you should attach cables in the PSU before you mount it."

Great cable management with built in straps and nooks to run cables. All parts fitted perfectly and I love the look of the case with everything installed.",

      "Solid case, easy to build in for my first build, but the lack of dust filters means some dust gets in. Also has some questionable design choices - the lack of top mount support kinda sucks, but you can top mount it anyway if you want and just remove the rear fan.",
      "-great cable management\n-generally very clean look",
      "Great case. Plenty of airflow of course, nice to see the weird toilet bowl from the 2022 version replaced with a more practical HDD/SSD mounting enclosure. The front glass panel having no screw anymore makes it feel a little bit sketchy when taking it off but it seems fine... Would be nice to have the sliding tray from the 2022 version back though, the 120mm fan cutouts look crappy with 140mm fans installed. The new top plate is a welcome upgrade over the dust filter and fixed roof from the previous. As a case on its own merits, it's a solid choice. The company itself is another matter..."

      "This case is so ******* good that I bought a second one for a backup PC. It's just so spacious and easy to cable manage with. Lots of room when putting your AIO in. Only thing that's annoying is that due to requiring the riser cable, you pretty much have to remove the GPU every time you want to access any of the motherboard ports below the PCIe slot. But that's a very minor quibble.",
      "Definitely a beautiful case, but I found it to be a bit of a pain initially to get the riser cable to seat onto the motherboard after I had secured the mobo to the case. Also I love that they included fan mounting spots underneath the GPU, definitely helps with the temps. Extremely pricey but you get what you pay for.",
      "This case is the magnum opus of cases. It is like if Lamborghini made computer cases. It is beautiful, spacious, and has possibly begun the next evolution of cases with the introduction of the LCD touch panel. Due to how new it is, I had to preorder it and wait for new stock to come in before they could ship it. Hyte did an amazing job with communication and the case was at my door the same they announced it had been shipped.\nThe case is very fun to build in but installing the motherboard can be very tedious due to the vertical riser mount that is built into the case. Unscrewing the front panel can also be a bit hard due to how small the screws are, but with proper tooling you can overcome that obstacle easy.\nI don't imagine myself ever getting another case after this. I can't go back after experiencing such beauty. But, if I do, it will just be another Y70 like this one :)",
      "Backorders make this case harder to get, but it is worth the wait, loving it."

      "PROS - GREAT CASE FOR ITS PRICE. great air flow and has PWM ARGB fans and a hub included.\nCONS - fans can get loud at higher rpms (but doesn't bother me). the side holes/garments on the case are a bit small. and positioning could be better.",

      "Spacious, looks good, easy to build in. Came with 4 fans which does cut down on costs and also comes with RGB. Plenty of cable management too at the back.",
      "A basic case for a basic setup. It has plenty of room to easily fit everything you need. RGB was easy to setup with the onboard hub. I like have the USB and headphone jack on top since my PC sits on the flow. Just wish the fan like on the front would show better through the mesh. Oh, well. Best to keep the dust out.",
      "Insane for like 65 to 70 bucks, and it has some great rgb effects for the price the value here is incredible! this is the second one I got that was not from micro center because taking a case halfway across a continent on a plane doesn't really make a lot of sense."

      "Looks great in my full black no RGB build. Good foot rest (I dont have space for it on my desk). Fits ATX PSUs with longer GPUs. (May have to mount psu at the top with no fan above if you have a long one.) No good space to hide cables, but to be expected with this size.",
      "I wanted the wood version but it was either sold out or overpriced. This one is just as good, though. I recommend having the PSU fan faced inside the case and have a case fan on the side grill to supplement air for both the PSU and CPU Cooler (either air or aio works I believe). Cable management would honestly be non existent if I had the traditional flat psu cables, but with the braidedish ones I got it was a lot more manageable especially with the dedicated cable routes placed around the case. I like it; it looks cool and has good potential for airflow. It's cheap af too. Bonus points for the plastic case with the screws and the included GPU sag thingy. (My cooling setup: GPU as intake for bottoms; I think you can probably fit in 2 MAYBE 3 120 slims underneath for extra intake, 2 exhaust fans 1 at the rear and 1 above it, 1 intake on the side mount sandwiched between the air cooler and psu perfectly fitted (thank god), psu fan facing inside the case. I don't recommend adding 2 extra exhaust at the top since it'll just suck out the air being provided by the side intake)",
      "This was my first smaller build and it was a bit challenging. This is a budget SFF case and as such it lacks many of the build customization options and cable management features. This is fine though since its fully mesh and you don't need it to look great inside. I stuffed a full size ATX PSU, a bigger 3080, and 280mm AIO in there without too much trouble. Would have been much easier with true SFF components for sure.",
      "I like this case a lot. They were very generous with the parts the included screws/parts. The manual was legitimately very helpful. It seems like a really versatile case, and it isn't bad to look at.\nIf I had to pick some nits: - The inner power-supply means you have to crack the case to fully turn the unit off. You only need to move a single panel, but it's a bit annoying. - The graphics card support is this sort of magnetic leg that I'm skeptical will really do anything to support my card. It seems like it will fall over if you move the case too much. The protective \"door\" in front of the PCIe screws means that the support that came with my would not work. I think I'll have to find some other way to protect against sagging",
      "Really nice case in my opinion, but very compact also, which is a plus in my eyes, but also a downside because I was was having trouble plugging in cables because of my fat fingers (sad times) but that's a big me problem for the most part than it is a case problem",
      "It's a great case, though you do have to compromise on cable management for size. Amazing size guides on the product page. Would have liked to gotten the wooden front but it seems like there isn't really a supply in Europe.",
      "Pretty slick little case, once you get used to it. If I ever build a smaller computer I'll probably go for this one. Only complaint is that the power supply switch is not immediately available, you need to remove the top cover.",
      "mATX is making a comeback and I'm here for it. Cheap, sleek and insanely breathable case. Every panel being mesh definitely plays into keeping everything cool. Wanted to go SFF from my ATX days, but didn't want to pay the ITX tax, so mATX was the move. A little tricky to build in with a traditional 140mm ATX PSU, but it handles it just fine. Take your time with assembly so you can route your cables in a way you'd like. I used a ton of zipties, but no one's gonna see it unless I open it up, which I'm sure I'll never have to do until it's time to dust it all off. You don't need a billion fans in this thing; EVERY PANEL IS MESH, so don't overcomplicate it. Aircooler? 1 fan on the side mount, 1 fan in the rear for exhaust. Run 1 up top for exhaust if you need to, but I don't think you will.",
      "It's a great case, though you do have to compromise on cable management for size. Just be aware that there are GPU size constraints depending on the size of your power supply and setup. Check the Lian Li A3 product page to see the maximum GPU length that can fit with your PSU.",
      "Fun to build in. Yeah, it's not going to be the highest quality material-wise. The plastic front plate is pretty bleh, but Lian Li now offers a wood option that is also mesh which is nice. But it looks good and is pretty straight-forward. 7 fan slots is really sold as well. Unfortunate that you have to purchase the TP side panel separately, but the price point of the base case is stellar."

      "I knew my next build will be in this case the moment i lay my eyes on it for the first time. I run it without any of the glass panels because of looks. Lian li just discontinued this case and replaced it with the compact version. That one is 10l smaller but with that it can not anymore support my radiator on the side. The Aqua Computer airplex radical copper are 360 radiator but they are as wide as 420 radiators. So they just fit when you also can support the mount for 140 fans. Which the normal Vision does.",
      "Great looking case for the 120 I paid for. It shows alot of cables in the front tho especially the gpu one",
      "Beautiful case, great customization, lots of space, amazing airflow if set up correctly, spacious to also work in, great cable management options in the back, front panel connectors were easy to set up, affordable price for a high quality build.\nA friend of mine recommended me a Lian Li case and I am very happy with buying one. First, it is spacious, it was a little heavy, but for a high quality case you should expect that. It can with a lot of extra nuts, bolts, and zip ties for more customization. In the back, they have great options for cable management, there are a lot of built in cable management options. I think the best way to set it up is with air coming in from the case fans and being pushed out by the CPU cooler. I have a 5:3 intake to exhaust ratio set for the airflow and it works great, it keeps everything very cool especially the GPU. The case does fit at most three 140mm fans at the bottom, I decided to go with three 120mm fans. On the back panel I fit two 120mm fans but I had to adjust the back a little bit to be able to fix that and anybody who buys this case be aware that you can fit two 120mm fans but there is a panel at the bottom on the back that you have to take out and move to the top to get a little more space. This is a beautiful case, it looks awesome, front panel connectors were easy to set up, love the usb-c option.",
      "Most people order this for the eye candy appeal (including me) but overall this case has great cable management and modularity. Fan install is really easy due to the removable bottom bracket and the removable side bracket. Very easy to build in, and the tool less nature of most of the case is a must have. While it may not have the best airflow, it more than makes up in modularity, cable management and ease of use.",
      "Amazing case, glass gets pretty dirty. If you are buying this because of the glass on top, don't. You will barely ever look down at it because it is so massive and I would've gotten the Hyte Y70 Touch Infinite than this, but the return window closed.",
      "Sheer unparalleled viewing angles, my mistake was only getting it in black. Cooling has not been in issue however. My main gripe with it besides personal reasons is that if you are using an AIO in this case (which I would assume that like 95%+of you are), that the length of the AIO tubes may be a concern because I had to basically fight to finally get on my Thermalright Frozen Infinity 360 installed.",
      "very epic saucing for its size for my parts and stuff",
      "My new favorite Case",
      "Good looking, even greater worksmanship. You can take it to parts to easily and you can install rads / fans very easily, has so much room for cables, looks so good, i love it.",

      "This cass is excellent to build in, and looks great. I made use of all of the fan slots so I am running a total of 10 case fans. I had to take my time with wiring because there was a huge mass of wires at first.\nI recommend assembling in this order:\n-Install CPU/Cooler/RAM/M.2ssd on board. -Install Board in Case. -Install Case Fans. -Completely wire the Case Fans and lock them down with zip ties.\n-Run the I/O wiring, lock it down. -Install GPU -Run and Lockdown power cable extensions (Or PSU cables if not using extensions) -Install PSU\nI like how easy it is to remove the panels, and the case is extremely clean looking. Plenty of airflow and cool temps."

      "Wonderful case! Most the panels come off to easy access to install all items. I panicked for a few seconds when trying to install my 5080 GPU and it would not fit, but realized the front right metal panel has a thump screw to remove it. After removing it there was a perfect space for the GPU which seemingly fills up the whole case.",
      "While this was the only aesthetic choice for my build, it's still an excellent case to work in. The main body is spacious and there's already two 140mm fans installed in the front. Works especially well with 2 1/2 slot GPUs, but can fit 3 slot cards in with a bit of extra elbow grease. The solid side panel does come off, and it makes for some nice extra room to work in. The dust filters at the top and front are also placed in excellent spots as to catch the dust without ruining the aesthetic. Keep it clean, and she'll be perfect for the gentlemanly or dadly gamer.",
      "The Fractal North looks like it was designed by tough, sensitive wood elves somewhere in Sweden.\nThe wood grate thing initially caught my eye and it would look even better were it standing upright, but I worry about the weight of the CPU cooler and 4070 Ti video card warping sockets and causing problems down the line, so I stuck little rubber feet to one of the case’s sides and keep it laid horizontally, which made me realize the bottom of the case could look nicer.\nCompartments are accessible and two fans are included and mounted behind the wooden grate on the front, which is also easily removable, which is nice.\nThe paper manual is of good quality, using black and white plus a single bright blue, almost cyan-like color, for clear instructional effect.\nThumb-screws of side compartments could use the help of a Dwarven blacksmith as their threads take a bit too much force to take hold.\nOverall, a beautiful case for Interwebs Communotron 2023, but the front sound inputs are noisy and the front USB connecters are unreliable, as usual for PC cases.",

      "Easy to work in, a premium look and feel. For the price it's well worth it. Would be nice if the top panel could be screwed in place as it comes off a bit too easily. Still deserves a full 5 stars though. There's really nothing else like it on the market in my opinion",
      "Great case, clean design, easy to work in.\nI'm not sure if my radiator was slightly longer than advertised, but I struggled to fit it where the specs stated it should fit (360mm in the front).\nAs other's have stated, getting the wires to the upper 24x2 plugs on the motherboard is tricky, there's very little room and a very small opening, but it is doable.",

      "Includes 4 fans, two of which intake cool air right on to the GPU and the other two are the massive 140mm in front of the case, this case even has a height-adjustable GPU sag bracket included. Plenty of space to work, just be sure to watch size if you're doing 1000+ watt PSUs as they may not fit. This case was my favorite purchase for this build at $79.99. Just beware if you plan on buying the B650 Tomahawk motherboard for this case, the B650 Tomahawk's front USB header connector is annoyingly perfectly in the worst possible spot for this case, so again just like I mentioned in the motherboard review of this PC: please remove the cable management bracket before trying to plug in the front USB header cord!\nOtherwise, a wonderful case. No, it doesn't even need an exhaust fan, the high intake pressure keeps the case perfectly cooled (More info on this case's temps can be found on Gamer Nexus' review on this case, it's pretty neat). Wish I had built my own PC in this instead of the Corsair 4000D.",
      "A really great budget case, but the power supply is at the front for some reason",
      "A high quality, unusual layout of a case that puts extra airflow where needed, has a built in gpu stand, and is a great deal for the price. The only downsides is a 150mm PSU length requirement and a relatively shallow back area for cables.",
      "Not many things to complain, from what i can remember, maybe the option to fit a 420 radiator would be a nice add for the next version.",
      "The best experience I've had building in a case so far. Great holes for cable management, namely the GPU cables. Having 2 intake fans dedicated to the GPU while having 2 front intake fans is great. I changed the front fans out with 2 Bequiet! Light wings 140mm. Shorter screws are provided with the case for 25mm fans. Big fan of this design.",
      "Purchased after watching product review by Gamers Nexus. Great case to build in and has excellent airflow with the stock fan setup. I was debating to add a rear exhaust fan but this thing belts so much air that I do not see a need for one right now. Some reviews mentioned issues with cable management but I did not experience any.\nNOTE:\nThe bottom rear section of the case is actually an intake vent (as pointed out by GN).\nI covered it up with a magnetized mesh filter that I had in my inventory.\nEnsure your PSU's length is < 160 mm (as pointed out by GN and Lian Li).\nThe PSU I picker is 140 mm in length and I had 0 issues with installation.\nAn optional dust filter can be purchased for $9.99.\nUnnecessary as the front panel (made of ultra-fine mesh) does an excellent job at keeping dust out.\nRefer:\nLian Li Lancool 207 Airflow Case Review | Cable Management, Build Quality, & Benchmarks",
      "Excellent case to build in for a 1st timer.\nExcellent cooling to the GPU.\nPower Supply works great where it is though the orientation of the socket with the extension cable was a little awkward with the Gigabyte PSU I got.",
      "Pros:\nAmazing airflow (especially for the GPU)\nGood amount of included Fans (2 140mm RGB and 2 120mm Black)\nMagnetic panels make working in the case very easy\nInbuilt anti-Sag bracket\nCable channels with included Velcro straps\nLooks very clean\nGreat price\nCons:\nPSU placement may make some cables barely long enough (mostly the 8 Pin CPU cable) though this depends on the PSU and nullified with cable extensions\nThe included fans were slightly misaligned for me\nThe magnetic back cover means that you have to pack cables tightly to prevent it from bulging",
      "Fun case to build in as it basically forces good cable management practices and reducing clutter. Including 2x 140mm RGB intake fans and 2x 120mm intake fans aimed right at the GPU is incredibly generous for the price—I didn’t even need to buy extra case fans. The tradeoff is that the PSU sits closer to the front, connected by a fixed, non-removable IEC extension cable. While it works with most PSUs using standard IEC C13/C14 plugs, it won’t play nice with beefy 1500W+ units that need IEC C19/C20 connectors. That’s no big deal, though—anyone splurging on a 1500W PSU is probably pairing it with a pricier case anyway. Overall, I’d highly recommend this for budget builds",
      "Good case but the included fans were disappointing, especially the fronts with their awful humming noise. Definitely consider replacing the fans with something else."

      "Incredible case for both aesthetics and use.",
      "So Much space to work in and come with 3 fans pre installed perfect for this with big hands and big GPU.",
      "A fun case to build in — this was my first time using a dual-chamber case so it was a little new to me... having to mess with the amount of RGB fan cables I did was a bit of a nightmare but in the end everything tidied up alright.\nDon't think these are the easiest cases to build in but they're definitely very attractive in the end.",
      "Looks great, stays cool, super easy to build in. Not sure why I saw so many people complaining about the fans built into this thing, they do just fine, I do have a ton of extra fans though. the top fan spots will fit either two 140mm fans or three 120mm fans.",
      "The fans that come with this case are worthless. It would have been better to sell this without fans since it seems most of us had to throw them away and buy another set anyway. As someone else said, scummy company for lying about the fans and many other things, including ripping off the design from another company.",
      "Looks Great, Lots of Fans, Lots of space, Good Price",
      "Nice and spacious, without having to worry about super strict cable management. I really like the two extra 140mm fan slots on the bottom for blowing straight into the GPU.",
      "Got it for very cheap but otherwise, amazing case. Fun to build in, lots of space in the back to hide the cables, great front presentation and the angled case fans are great for temps while keeping the dual-chambered design",
      "The case is beautiful, priced right, and was a joy to build in. If you decide to build a custom loop in this case, measure your rads very carefully. Lots of room in the back chamber.",
      "Beautiful case. Cools well. No complaints. Would be nice if there were more front I/O, but rear has plenty."

      "Great value case. Comes with 4 Phanteks M25 140mmfans, the fans move a ton of air and run quiet while keeping my system cool.",
      "Is a pretty good case for what it is, however it definitely needs refinement. For starters the front, and rear panels get stuck sometimes, when pulling them off. The rear panel is moderatly easy to get on. But the front panel is very hard to get on. One thing to note is to use a smaller aio, the arctic freezer 3 360 barley fit, I had to remove the rear fan, in order to fit it. It has a dust cover at the top, and the bottom for the power supply. However not for the front or rear. What's even the point in that case, the dust will still get in (not so much in the rear exhaust, but front intake.). Other than these issues it is a very nice case.",
      "Nice roomy case with plenty of space and spots for cable management. Very basic but clean look. Included fans are pretty nice.",
      "Great value case. Comes with 4 Phanteks M25 140mmfans. A single one of those fans costs quarter of the whole case in my area. The fans move a ton of air and run quiet while keeping my system cool.\nIt really doesn't have any special features, or anything fancy to improve aesthetics. But in this they were able to cut the cost by reducing the extras, rather than cheaping out and making the case lower quality. Everything feels sturdy, and looks great for the price.\nA breeze to build in for my very first build.",
      "I wish it was dual-chamber, but for the price I can't complain, the four preinstalled fans are nice. I strongly recommend.",
      "Great, budget case, but I wish I could control the RGB fans and had more room when building.",
      "Amazing case for its price range. Comes with 4 (3 frontal intake/1 rear exhaust) 140mm fans which come daisy-chained for super easy installation. Cables come pre-managed and the front header cable is bundled all in 1 connector making installation again, super easy.\nWhen you screw in the motherboard, it still has some upper clearance so you don't need to pre-route the PSU cables. It also has a cut-out in the fake floor so the GPU cable can slide in for a super clean and efficient routing option.\nAll in all, I highly recommend this case to anyone looking for a cheap, robust and streamlined case that will make your build way easier.",
      "This case was so easy to build in. It was very spacious and the wires in the case were pre-cable managed. Super good for its price.",
      "Looks great and was great to build in. Case is good quality, and easy to cable manage in. No complaints.",

      "Overall great case! Great airflow, great looks, easy to work in with super easy cable management, I'd say it's just the right size as well, only downside I can think of is the metal part of the front panel has a captive thumbscrew which isn't very captive.",
      "Great case, excellent airflow, easy to cable manage in, best case I've ever worked with. Looks great too.",
      "No comments, beautiful, clean and good airflow",
      "Okay, I pulled a muscle lifting this assembled, otherwise it's great.",
      "10 out of 10 case its so clean and the wood front panel is chiefs kiss",
      "A great minimalist PC Tower. The 3 included intake 140mm fans will keep your components VERY chilled. Only (small) downside is the included thumb screws, as they're very easy to accidentally strip the threads on them :(",
      "This is a great case. It has more than enough room for most builds. That said, its pretty clear it wasn't designed for custom water cooling. It can support 3 x 140mm radiators but just barely. It is quite the puzzle and order of operations in important. AIO's were probably the intended use case for the 3 x 140 front slots.\nThere is excessive room in the main part of the case. I don't see there being an issue fitting any type of air cooler. I wish they would have moved the motherboard tray over even just 10 mm to give a little extra room in the back. That said what I did with this case isn't normal and any other build would probably find the current room more than enough.\nFor as big as the main compartment is. I'm a little disappointed to not see a vertical mounting solution stock in the case. There is enough room to do a triple slot card and still be able to use the existing PCI-e slots. I ended up making my own but would have been a nice to have.\nEverything else is very well built. I would also like to see the top panel be fastened with screws instead of rivets. Would make installing larger radiators a lot easier if the top panel could be removed easily.\nFront panel is absolutely gorgeous and has nearly zero airflow restriction. Definitely what helped to set the theme of this build.",
      "Fantastic case, amazing airflow and so easy to work inside. Great cable management, comes with a PWM fan-hub for simplifying fan connections. Looks pristine and really ties into a room with a lot of dark wood, the style went a long way in purchasing this.\nEven the glass case has mesh on the top, so be aware that sound travels quite easily. You'll need quiet fans to avoid hearing this. But, compared to my Fractal Define R5, for the same amount of noise you get much lower temps.\nSo I'd say get this case for a noise build, and maybe put something on top of the top mesh to isolate noise?",
      "This Fractal Design North XL case? Pure Scandinavian elegance! Okay, the screws and lack of a quick-release aren't quite as rock-solid as my old Define, and I find the threads on the holes are not that durable, easy to strip hence the one-star deduction. BUT...that power button! So smooth, so satisfying. Plus, it's the perfect size and looks absolutely smoldering... I mean, super cool. Ahem. 😉"

      "Lian Li has never disappointed me when it comes to cases. This is the second case I have built in and it did not disappoint. Comes with everything you need to start building with a little box for hardware screws etc. I would recommend this case if you are looking for a mATX or even ITX and want to use a standard ATX power supply. You will have more than enough room to work with.",
      "Well priced, great looking, very good compatibility. Assembly in it was pretty stress free sans radiator compatibility with LF3. Removing all the panels is so simple and they include soo many bags of screws for different use cases.",
      "The case looks nice and the final product is definitely awesome on my desk.\nPlenty of room inside for configurations and different cooling setups.\nI have to dock a star because cable management is not a thing this case was designed for, and even with my relatively minimal number of cables it's not great.",
      "Great to build in but the cable management is weak",
      "Outside, this is a great case, the wood panel gives it a very high end look comparing to the plastic version. Air-flow-wise, many ways too choose according to the manual. I went with 2 intake fans at the bottom, and 2 exhaust at the top. Temp is good. Even without case fans, the CPU barely exceeds 85C. However, there are issues with the case. The biggest one is the lack of back spaces for cable management. If you choose this case, you are just bunching your cables together inside the case, so I highly recommend using the Mesh side panel instead of the tempered glass one. Furthermore, if you go for an ATX instead of SFX PSU, the cable management is going to be even messier. So be prepared. I’d recommend watching Youtube videos of building inside this case to get a sense on how to properly cable management. I dont’t want to make too much effort so I just go for it lol. If I can choose again, I would go for the Asus AP201; it’s cheaper and have better cable management option; it just doesn’t have the cool wood panel.",
      "Very good design and well built case. The space to do cable is pretty large for M-ATX case. Mesh panels keep my PC cool. And have wood.",
      "This case was a blast to build in. Do buy more zip ties than you think you need, as managing cables in this case is tough to get just right due to the lack of places to hide them. Go for the wood paneled version over any other, as you can swap out the front panel for other custom versions online and you will definitely benefit from having a ventilated front panel for PSU mounting. I would also snag an EPS extension cable to make management a bit cleaner, otherwise you may find that it hangs over the motherboard. Other than that cable, sfx PSUs have comfortable cable lengths overall, and I did like that I went for that instead of a full size model as it would have restricted my cable management and GPU placement even further. I dont know how people are squeezing 360mm aios into this chassis but if anyone has any tips, I would love to hear it. All in all, it's a great bridge between ITX and mid tower, and looks great. Solid airflow as well, especially with rear fans for intake.",
      "I like this case a lot. It feels like the Fractal Terra's younger brother. Solid build quality for the price, the panels fit into place well and come on/off easily. Nice accessories box that comes with it, including some small zip ties.\nIt can be a bit tricky to manage or hide the cables, but at the end of the day you can't really peek through the window on it to see them. The number of fans you can fit in this as well is crazy, alongside flexible AIO and GPU fitment.\nWould build in this again happily.",
      "Love this case's aesthetic and how cooling/gpu combinations can be accounted for with the psu having many different orientations. I was able to fit a 360mm AIO and 4080s in this case.",
      "Lovely little box. Great size. Pretty design. Fits mATX, a 360mm radiator and long GPUs. PSU can be mounted at multiple points along the front allowing some different configs. The wood version actually has a mesh panel behind the bars allowing you to face the PSU fan frontwards to intake fresh air (the plastic front versions of this case have solid front panels). Comes with no fans but includes lots of optional hardware to customize your build like PSU standoffs and a side fan mounting bracket.\nImpressive compatibility for its petite size. Not particularly expensive. Cable management is a bit lacking but it makes up for it on nearly every other aspect so I won't dock any stars for that."

      "Over the top, and unnecessary, the touch screen is gimmicky, and it's so big it'll be awkward to place anywhere. But GOD DAMN is it a beauty. It feels ostentatious, what a purchase, I don't regret it one bit.",
      "This might be the most over the top expensive case out there. Materials used are premium, case feels sturdy and accessing its different sections is easy. Working on it was fine for the most part, the cutouts hide cables well but cable management options in the back is weak compared to other brands. No extra case fans despite the price so might put off a lot of people. Software is meh especially for the premium price you're paying. If I were to make a case choice again I would probably still go for the Hyte Y70 but without the screen.",
      "I absolutely love this case. It is very easy to build in, the instructions that come with it are mostly helpful but may be difficult for some as it is just pictures and it was difficult to determine what part of the case I was working in at times. The program for the screen is also easy to use and makes the case look amazing. I should have plenty of room to upgrade my GPU in the future especially with the side mount that is built in.",

      "Very nice to build in. All 4 side panels and top panel can be removed with ease. Not too expensive given the aesthetic and build quality.",
      "Main selling point for me is the 45 degree intake panel. A beautiful compact design case which really showcases anything you want to fill it with.",
      "It's neat and I like that the fan angles more towards the components.",
      "fav case ever realy good airflow",
      "It's a mixed bag. Don't get me wrong I love the case as it boasts a sleek and attractive design that will undoubtedly catch your eye. It provides ample space for components and has good airflow to keep your system cool. I particularly love the angled fans that direct air towards the GPU and motherboard, rather than right up against the glass, and also how you can hide the fans in the bottom like they're part of the frame.\nHowever, it has two major drawbacks. One is the lack of real dust filters. Without them, dust accumulates quickly, and I've found myself needing to clean it out just about every week. Also, it's just 2mm to small to fit anything LianLi in it, unless you're alright with forcing your parts in.",
      "A joy to build in and looks great. There's tons of room and all of the panels are removable. I love how the bottom has a spot to insert two 140mm fans.",
      "Best case ive ever built in aesthetics wise as well as ease of building.",
      "Gorgeous case and lots of room for cable management an clear instructions",
      "Impressed by the case design, although I couldn't get the RGB version at a good price. Swapped out the non-RGB fans for Arctic P12 ARGB ones. The stock fans were moved to the roof of the case. Good wire management options and clean design, what more does one need (although I did almost buy the HYTE Y70 :P)?",
      "Great Case, it looks amazing and cable management is a breeze. the Fans are angled and provide exceptional Airflow."

Absolutely no problem, just rearrange the case.\nYou don't want the USB ports on the front but on the side of the case? No problem there either, just click it in somewhere else.",
      "Lian Li has always made some awesome PC Towers, such as the Lian Li O11 Dynamic. I went with the O11 Dynamic EVO RGB, as it's an update to the O11 Dynamic Evo from 2021. I got it at microcenter for $159.99, and for the price you get a lot of great features. It's got plenty of room for a 40 Series graphics card and my massive radiator for my CPU cooler.",
      "Highly highly recommend. Heavy case, but incredibly well made and fun to build in. Love the modularity and the glass is a great look.",
      "3rd best case I've ever built in, just slightly losing to the O11 Vision and O11 Vision Compact. I couldn't use either of the Vision cases as I wanted a dual AIO setup.",
      "Love the looks of this case",
      "Good case to build in, with cable management strips and grommets. Panels comes off and install easily. Easy fan bracket installation. Looks great.",
      "Sturdy case with room for 10x120mm case fans, however no case fans are included. This case lets you mount the motherboard in a high and low setting. When mounted in the high setting a small part of the case frame blocks my gpus 1st display port connection on the rear. I can still use my hdmi and dp 2 and 3 connections. This is a great looking case with bright RGBs that you can change the visual mode and brightness using buttons by the power switch. I removed the vertical bar where the two glass panels meet to make the case look even better and it still seems sturdy. Does not come with any case fans so be ready to invest in fans. For example my case fans cost more than my case, feels weird admitting that... probably should return those now that I think of it.... BRB!",

      "Pretty nifty for its price. 7 fans is awesome yet they are pretty loud. As a first time builder, it wasn't a pain to build in. The included fan hub has the RGB and PWM pre rigged, but it gets messy down there. It looks so beautiful, though.",
      "terrible manual, loud fans, no labeled screws, hell to put the motherboard into, not compatible with most of its own screws for the motherboard. this case made my life miserable.",
      "I love this case I wanted a somewhat fishtank build but I didn't want a giant case and this was perfect the only downside is there isn't alot of space for cables in the back, but otherwise it's a solid buy.",
      "Fans are pretty quite even on 40-50% speed, after 50% it gets louder but it makes sense. Has a lot of fans and I liked that, but the look of the case in general, isn't \"beatiful\", but for it's price WITH installed fans worth it. There is good enough space for cable management.",
      "looks really good and has great value, but a bit of a pain to build in",
      "amazing looking case, included fans and hub are good",
      "I love the way it looks, the 7 fans it's a steal and has a pretty good fan layout but I have to take a star out for the mesh on top, the screws for the AIO make the mesh look wavy and it's not cool, but the dual chamber and the space to operate it is top notch.",
      "First build for me so I don't have much other reference, but the full ATX motherboard fits fully in the case and there's not much room for the USB headers on the bottom with the fans. had to cram a few wires. But it looks so clean I really can't complain",
      "This case is a monster for it's price. Looks good, comes with 7 fans, and the design is really polished.\nThe only small \"downside\" is that there is not a lot of room to manage the cables in the back. I would recommand a back connect motherboard to peer with it. While it's unnecessary, it will really make the case even cooler while making the cable management easier.",

The 3 glass panels make this a gorgeous case and really display every component inside. Ample space in the back for the power supply and cables.",

Cable management placement in the back became awkward, and chunky cables can pop out the rubber covers, but that's my issue. The \"wood texture\" is a hit or miss depending on your setup aesthetic, it can kind of look like a smudge.",

      "--- UPDATE: 3/31/25 --- GRRR! I was trying to install some new fans, and I learned that the \"two bottom\" fan support is a lie!!! The holes drilled there are not the right size for even repositioning their own fans that come with the case. That deducts a star.\nThis case... is interesting. It has a ton of cable management room in the back and comes with two pre-installed fans (not PWM). The way the case is made, there is room on the front and back of the front fan mount for fans. It looks like you can fit 3 fans on the inside side of the bracket, but they will only fit on the outside. The documentation is kind of meh, but I would recommend it as long as you know what you are doing.",
      "High quality small case for the price, removable dust filter at the bottom near the PSU, tempered glass, comes with 2 fans. Front panel is secured by plastic clips, which easily pull right off using a bit of force with your hands if you need to install extra front fans. Keep in mind you can only fit a max 290mm GPU and 150mm CPU cooler"

This may be an error on my part, but not a big deal especially because I have a 3D printer. Also, AIO mounting process was a little odd, but I eventually figured it out. Looks amazing!",

      "A joy to build in, a joy to look at. The front plate is prone to finger smudges - that is the only realistic drawback of this case. So long as you calculate GPU/CPU clearance well (see GamesNexus YT), you won't get turbulence. High quality, good manual, perfect for an mITX build - even if it's your first.",
      "Best looking case in its class. Easy to work in with the right parts and the GPU riser is a nice feature that makes building a snap. The only thing I think Fractal should change is the plastic hinge pins/latches on the gull-wing doors. Seems like that should be metal to be on par with the quality of the rest of the case.",
      "There were a couple of quirks building in this case, especially for a first time build. Visually stunning, though the black does easily get dirty (but can easily be cleaned), issue doesn't occur on other colours.\nWould ultimately like to see steps for the spine vs. freely sliding. Leaves less flexibility, but I prefer having a more uniform/deliberate spine position than having it be potentially crooked. Had to adjust the spine a couple times because one end would keep pulling towards one side.",
      "Love Love Love Love this case.",
      "Dream ITX case. A pleasure to build in.",
      "Solid case, and it also feels quite solid. Looks nice and sleek, especially the front walnut finish, and takes up very little desk space. However, the design of the side panels causes quite a bit of fan turbulence (especially since my parts are quite close to the edges), and one of the spine screw slots was unusable. However, the cable management was quite easy, so points for that, especially in SFF.",
      "Beautiful design, easy to build in to for an ITX. The adjustable spine to increase/decrease the width for GPU or CPU side is a game changer!",
      "Easy to work in and looks great. Not more I can ask for when looking for an ITX case.",
      "Absolutely love the case. Kinda wish I was bold enough to try the jade green. The instructions were easy to follow, and I had no issues with any mounting locations. One small thing they could have done is better label the mobo screws vs the power supply screws. If they would make it like 3-5mm wider I think it would be much easier for people to choose coolers in the future.",
      "I really liked the look of this case, and it was much easier to build in than I expected. ITX cases do come at a premium cost, but with the size and ascetics it was worth it to me."

      "It has a secret compartment... what more do I have to say?\nJokes aside, the secret area is great once you remove the HDD cages, you can fit a whole controller in there to take up less desk space and then the small box in front is great for storing USB drives or small adapters! The rest of the case is also great, looks cool and the fans are really quiet, mesh design on the front is nice, and building is pretty easy. Cables are a little squished in the back but not a huge problem.",
      "This case is bigger than the picture so it caught me by surprise when it came in\nAnyway its great and easy to work with has very nice quiet, fans Fractal did very good with this case other than you need to buy a USB-C port for the front panel",
      "Best case I've ever worked with EXCEPT that you have to buy an extra cable in order for the USB C port to work.",
      "5.25\" Drive bays in 2023 is such a convenience with this case... sucks you have to pay $15 for a USB-C cable that should come with the case, though. Other than that, 5 stars.",
      "This case is an absolutely fantastic piece of kit.\nFor those seeking 5.25 bay integration, you cannot disservice yourself with this. There is ample space for GPU breathing, unlike the smaller variations. The glass has two strips on it that make installing it easier without fingerprinting it up. A positive pressure environment is easily generated using almost any set of fans in this case. The magnets on the 5.25 bay are just as strong as I would like them to be. The power button has a great tactile feel. The hexagonal patterns are tasteful, practical and easy to clean. The PSU shroud does not obstruct oppresively. Cable management was a breeze due to the basement and drive sleds are easily relocated. The case includes a button driven RGB controller, if you're into that sort of thing, which tends to be superior to software driven solutions. The space for tall CPU air coolers, like D15s, is available. This case is nearly a grand slam, if not for it's weakpoints...\nThe weakpoints of this case are the lack of rubber grommets (not a huge deal), the stock fan quality (no PWM), the fact the 5.25 bay shield pops off easily when moving the case, the middle top fan slot is useless for anything other than intake, cable management room on the side is wanting (mitigated somewhat by the basement)...\nBut by far the most weak point is the lack of inclusion of an integrated type C port from Fractal, which they sell separately for 30-40 bucks on various websites. This is a complete and utter ripoff. These exact cables are procurable in the form of PCIE slot \"adapters\" for less than 20 dollars (often close to 10) that perform a literally identical function (same exact cable, just attaches to case differently, on an open PCIE slot), and this case will provide a full entire extra PCIE slot at the bottom for ATX motherboard users that is completely unobstructed. Oftentimes too, the top PCIE slot is not GPU-occupied on ATX boards. EZDIY is a brand I recommend and I simply used their type C PCIE slot unit instead of Fractal's.\nFractal Josh, if you read this, this case was perfect other than the inclusion of the \"fake\"/upcharged type C port to save cost on the tooling/production line. I dislike this trend in your cases.\nAlso, people are already used to replacing the fans in your cases anyways, but it would be nicer if you were like Lian Li, Corsair or Be Quiet and included some decent 1200 RPM PWM fans in more of your cases instead of these 3 pinners. I have boxes full of Fractal fans from over the years and it's honestly just such a waste of material... and I feel like I would've used the fans if they were PWM.\nAll in all, 4 stars, 1 star off for the flaws, but in summation this is the best 5.25 bay implementation that you can get in a case without looking to the CoolerMaster NR series, which is dated and awful by comparison. This case feels fresh and experienced Fractal fans will be happy.\nMy personal favorite case that fits ATX sizes.",
      "This is the best case of the 3 cases I have ever built in. If you are like me and need a case with space for an optical drive in 2023 Look no further. My only complaint is the length on some of the fan cables could have been a tiny bit longer as I was forced to use certain Motherboard headers due to cable length. That however might also be on asus for the positioning of their headers. I've managed to fit 3x 3.5\" Spinning HDD's and an Optical Drive into this case alongside the NVME I boot from. The ARGB on the included fans is nice and they connect better than some of the other ARGB devices I have in my built which is a plus. I would totally go for any of the variants of this case in future builds",
      "I gave it 1 less star because I had to order the USB C cable for this case from Japan because no retailer in the US had the cable in stock. I contacted Fractal Design and they didn't have any in stock. They underestimated the demand for the cable and didn't have enough. The only other issue is that I didn't have a hex driver small enough to remove the power supply shroud. Within the shroud is a cage to hold hard drives or SSDs. This could cause future expansion problems. I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Other than those 2 issues, this is an excellent case.",
      "Really happy with this case.\nReasons why I bought this case:\nCan hold an EATX motherboard with plenty of room.\nCan mount a 360 AIO cooler in front\nCan mount a 4090 video card without touching the front mount 360 AIO\nFractal quality\nPrice\nOh yeah, it has an option for 5.25\" drives. Yes I know I am old. Yes I still have an extensive movie (bluray) and game disc collection. I like having options. It works for me. Its hidden out of view.\nWas easy to work in. Has plenty of space. Was somewhat easy to cable manage in. I would highly recommend this case for the average user. Good price, decent options. Nothing to complain about. It works for me and I am extremely happy. Was able to find a color scheme for the fans that works with the MSI Z790 Ace motherboard color profile.\nSo far, everything is cool temperature wise, and the fans are quiet.",
      "Used the case because I needed the room for the components. It's a large case, but not as \"huge\" as it seems from the dimensions, but definitely \"full tower\". It was priced right and the build quality, though not premium was quite good. The metal is just thinner than a more expensive case. Nice options for a case this inexpensive.\nI need extra tray room for the motherboard since the connectors at the bottom of the motherboard point downward, not outward and the board is full ATX. Also, due to the large heatsinks, wanting to use a 280 radiator, I needed the depth of the case or width, whichever you call it, not to mention the width of the GPU so the cables are not pressed against the glass panel as they were in another case I tried to use it in. Even with the size of the case, I think the components are balanced and fill the space, but with a sense of aesthetic roominess. It was certainly easy to build in.",
      "A wonderful case to build in. Truly one of the few cases that are worth building with. However, due to its cheap price, Fractal did have to cut corners. The included argb fans are abysmal in performance. It CANNOT keep up with the high speeds of my ALFII so I had to swap em for better ones. And no included USB C front io. Not a case for aircooling without some significant upgrades."

      "Good for it’s price, although there isn’t a lot of room in the back to stuff cables. If you’re on a budget, this case has a nice design and some RGB fans. Recommend.",
      "Fantastic product cooling, internal fans limit interchangeable parts, however, the structure and setup of the tower is great. Great for an entry level build without breaking the bank.",
      "Good case, pretty big and comes with 6 RGB (rainbow fixed - there's a button to turn it off if desired) fans already, although molex. I like the front panel with the fractal mesh and the side glass panel door, it gives a premium vibe to the case.\nThe material feels a bit cheap, but it's a budget case so I can get behind that considering everything else the case provides.",
      "Great budget case. Cable management was pretty easy, but there wasn't really much room in the back to work with. You do get a lot of fans, but the fan RGB is fixed, and you can't control the speed at which the fans spin. Material is pretty cheap too. Despite all this, it's just a case and has great features many other cases at this price range won't.",
      "The case material feels cheap, and it is. The back panel is warped now somehow, but I assume that my family could have been rough with it or something. It comes with a lot of fans (3x140, 4x120) so that's definitely a huge plus. This is a good budget case, just know that you're getting what you paid for in quality.",
      "You won't find a better mid tower in this price point. Tons of included fans (Although mine are static RGB, which kind of stinks, but I saved insane cash.) and a decent build quality. Not the best for cable management but it's more than serviceable (looking at you molex chain)",
      "Good case to build it, some sharp edges and comes with everything you need and more, mesh is easy to accidentally tear, I would be careful :)",
      "Tons of fans, a nice design, and good airflow.\nHowever, if you don't look at the fine print you won't realise that the RGB is fixed, and that all of the fans are connected to a molex centipede in the back of the case.\nLoses a star for that, but again Montech coming in clutch with the budget cases.",
      "Great case, but didnt know you cant switch the rgb. Its always just the same. The fans are Molex.",

      "There's a reason people love this case. It's not cheap. It's not going to win you any best system temp awards. It's honking huge. But it looks phenomenal and I do not regret it for a second. This is way more case than my system needed in order to perform its tasks, but it looks absolutely gorgeous. I will likely eventually upgrade to the touchscreen when Hyte gets their supply chain woes sorted out later this year."

      "Case: Montech King 95 Pro. Exceeded my expectations. The best case I have ever used and had. Super easy and fun to build in and made building for a noob pc builder like me super easy. I highly recommend this case especially (pro version). It comes with 6 pre installed fans and an rgb/fan hub at the back which supports up to 10 fans. Amazing case, very spacious, quality materials and good looking. 10/10 would buy again, especially for a new builder. The fans are pristine for the price and they look amazing and are quiet. The cable management is super easy as there are 2 holes at the bottom, 2 at the top and 2 beside the motherboard for cables to run through. Makes PC building super easy even for new pc builders. Comes with a lot of things. A mesh panel is included if you want to add more airflow and you are able to install more fans by moving the rear 140mm fans to the front and I believe you can add 3 120mm fans at the back, but not 100% sure but you can add atleast another 2 140mm making it 11 fans total if moving fans to front. The case comes with a box including all screws and it is labelled. Absolute amazing case for a brand new PC build.",
      "Sturdy case and quite roomy. The separate PSU section is clean...Montech made cable management a breeze with extra ties, wraps, accessories; the fan cables were already grouped together. The glass seems to be very durable. At this price point, value is hard to beat with the fans. They run pretty quiet under load. I have yet to enable custom colors through the mobo - at least they have ~20 presets. Was initially going for a non-RGB build but I like the subtle outlines on the fans. For any PC building, I suggest not building on the floor (RIP my back).",
      "Comes with 6 fans pre-installed 2 140m on the side set as intake 3 120m set on the bottom as intake, 1 on the rear as exhaust. they are all connected to a rgb hub powered by a sata cable on the PSU the front pannel connector comes all in one so i didnt have to deal with that, rgb on the fans are beautiful",

      "H7 Flow (2024) has a ton of space, appreciable airflow in all directions, built-in hooks and straps for convenient cable management, mesh dust filters (decent at keeping dust away), durable, and three (3 x 120mm) pre-installed intake fans. I appreciate the simplistic design, making disassembling and assembling the PC straightforward.",
      "It is a biiiiiig, heavy as **** and airy case. Honestly doesn't really fit under my desk too well.. but the size keeps stuff cool! and it fits the GPU. I like its convenience features, like the no screw side panels and the pre-installed motherboard spacers.\nOnly problem (and I wont deduct a star for this) is the lack of 5.25 drive bays, I might have had to put the HDD on a piece of foam loose in the bottom of the case.. but hey!! it worked out in the end.",
      "Really good case to build in, tons of room in all directions, good cable management, and it just looks great."

      "sooooo much room. so customizable. heavy as hell though",
      "Pros:\nA massive improvement over the original O11 XL\nCable management in mind and made easy\nCustomizability\nAlmost entirely toolless\nYou can reverse the case\nWater cooling in mind\nSturdy steel structure\nInstalling parts is made incredibly easy\nComes with plenty of screws and parts along with replacement ones\nComes with a GPU anti-sag bracket that mounts to 2 motherboard screw down points (for ATX boards, EATX boards require the use of a special mount for the anti-sag bracket to mount onto which is included)\n420mm radiator support on the top, bottom, and side\nCan fit fans almost everywhere and a lot of them ( I have nine 140mm fans and two 120mm)\nCons:\nIt's a heavy case and gets heavier the more parts you add to it\nIt's big and takes up a lot of room\nMinor Grievances:\nNone\nFinal Thoughts:\nMy previous PC build utilized the original O11 XL. This updated version is leaps and bounds better then the original. The customizability, the ability to reverse the case, and more mounting support makes working in this case blissful. I would recommend this case, especially for those who are doing custom water cooling loops or are looking to switch from 120mm fans to 140mm fans like me. However, this case is big and extremely heavy and just gets even more heavier the more parts you add into it. If space is an issue I would recommend getting the regular O11 EVO.",
      "This Tower is so easy to work with and has so much customization and cable organization features.",
      "Love the case. Mounted mb mount at bottom for room for the two rear fans. Tight room for cables, but it gives the front side more room I guess. Bottom 140 fans and the push pull 120s AIO at the side are intake. Top 140s and rear 120s are exhaust. I do not like the gpu flange mounts. There is a metal flap that hinges down on where the screws would be. First problem it is not square to the mb so the gpu tilts a little downward lengthwise. Second problem is you cannot use gpu support bar which will not fit the mount system. I wish Lian Li had a mod kit for a screw system. Another issue I found probably my own fault: when mounting the front glass I chipped the paint with the metal locator tabs attached to the bottom of the glass. The case edge there is painted aluminum and easily chipped. I did it twice lol. I touched up the paint with Testors flat black enamel model paint, matched perfectly fyi.",
      "Excellent case. Large, easy to work in, and cable management systems are lovely. Building my PC was very easy, did not experience any cuts or sharp objects, with many configuration options to choose from, I was satisfied with building on this case.",
      "Very spacious making it easy to build in, comes with nice accessories to tidy up everything it's a very solid case.",
      "The case is large, but not as large as I expected. It's no larger than the one I was using, the dimensions are just slightly different. The routing of the 12VPWR cable and GPU PCIE ribbon cable are a bit of a challenge, but it worked out after I reversed the orientation of the GPU so the support was at the top rather than the bottom. I think it looks better as well. I also purchased a 3' HDMI exension cable to run from the GPU to outside the case for convenience. The case provides a bracket with a cutout for this purpose and there is also a grommet in the back you can use if you orient the GPU with the support down.\nMy PSU fit. It's an ATX but longer due to the wattage. There is ample cable management, but it fills up fast. The case is about 95% toolless even for inverting the layout. It's all simpler than the be quiet case making that modular change.\nFor me this makes better use of the space and is more aesthetically pleasing. You can also get a mesh front panel for the case if you want more fans. You can mount up to a 420mm radiator in three different places depending where you want the GPU mounted. I'm not sure if it would mount in the front supposing you used the mesh panel rather than glass. I wouldn't count on it, but perhaps.",
      "Looks so nice and it was a breeze to build in. 10/10 would build again, possibly the easiest case I've ever built in before.",
      "there ist still room for improvment but overall ok",
      "Absolutely beautiful case. Love the aesthetic of it. Cable management kind of sucks though. It’s awkward not being able to relocate the psu to the bottom like past o11 models. And the hot swappable hard drive cages are just a nuisance now. Front side is a massive improvement, but the back where you manage the cables needs to be better."

      "This was so much fun to build inside. Everything looks and feel so clean.",
      "Absolutely gorgeous case. Loved using it and had plenty of room to guide and hide cables. Also came with a bunch of straps and two case fans. Feels sturdy and love the USB-C in the front panel.\nOnly complaint is how finnicky the sidepanel is to put back in, but since that's not a thing I'll do often, it doesn't matter.",
      "Absolutely love this case. I had my eye on it for a while and pulled the trigger on the mesh variant. The only RGB is the warm glow from the front radiator fans. Very sleek and fits nicely with my home office vibe.",
      "classy, modern tower - arrived in a big package, easy to build in - love it.\nI took out the 140mm Aspect fans, because I saw people complaining that they are mediocre... also the audio cable is ketchup-mustard colored not a fan but oh well",
      "Absolutely stunning case that has changed my perspective on life.",
      "Slick and neat. I got the black meshed version and it's great. Assembling your set-up is easy, it offers enough cut-outs and gaskets for your cable management. The wooden front is really nice and the overall quality is excellent.",
      "This case is phenomenal in both looks, and useability. It's great that it has a mesh panel for better airflow and a fan hub so only one fan header can be used. Does lack hardware compatibility a bit which can be fixed by going with the XL version if necessary.",
      "Nicest chassis on the market imo. So sleek, so clean, and no rgb makes for a stealthy and elegant build. Plenty of room for cable mgmt, good amount of ports on the front panel, and the mesh version keeps air flowing.",
      "amazing case, excellent customer support, easy to work on, lots of quality of life features, came with everything you could need, looks great",
      "Beautiful case, exactly as I imagined. My only complaints: I wish it was a bit smaller, and I wish it was a bit easier to take off the panels. Would've preferred a magnetic glass panel instead of thumb screws."

      "got it for like 70 or something. absolutely LOVE the look of this case. plus it feels good and is nice to build in",
      "This was the Case that started the whispers in the back of my head for this build. Was between this or a itx build with the NR200. The \"toilet\" fan is good, Case has great looks and the tempered glass panel is nice.",
      "Small case with lack luster airflow. Bought this because it looked great at a good price, but you have to spend money on extra fans becaus eof the lack of airflow. Seems to be what NZXT does as they cheap out on one aspect causing you to spend more money with them. Would much rather have put more money into a different case, however it does have great looks. Little cord management space too.",
      "Toilet bowl fan is a bit funny when used with the RX 6600 in my build but it seems harmless. Built in fans aren't great but they work fine. Not a lot of space for HDD/SSDs either, glad the bottom fan was replaced in the 2024 version. Generally a great case to build in, lots of airflow. Solid case, not so solid company...",
      "Looks very sleek and has very good airflow and cable management, also love how easy it is to take off the tempered glass panel and get into your PC. Unfortunately it barely has a front IO, it is very inconvenient for me. 1 USB on the front is really austere for a $100 case. If I was to rebuild my PC I would definitely look into options that give me more front IO.",
      "Not the easiest to build in if you have large fingers, and not the most room in the backside for cable management.",
      "Good case, great airflow. i just wish it had more room for cables.",
      "AMAZING CASE! Great airflow, comes with 2 fans, easy cable management, and as clean as any other NZXT case.",

      "You get what you pay for... I love the look of it, it's not giving budget at all appearance wise. But getting everything to fit was another story. I had to remove some parts and take the thing apart quite a bit to get everything to fit. The GPU cord in the front is up against the clear panel and it's getting pushed on a tiny bit, but I do have a large GPU. The bigger cords coming out of the back really had to be tied up just to get the back of it on. Good luck getting top fans installed. Despite all this it's fine for my needs and would be great for a smaller build.",
      "Pretty alright case, there are certainly better options out there tho. My main problem is that its too short for the biggest gpus out there tho, like the 3 fan xfx cards. also the cpu power cable is horrible to plug in, might just be me tho.",
      "The fans are all connected with the funny connectors that connects directly to the psu, not a fan hub.",
      "great case for the price, nah, it's a great case in general. no complaints, although it was pretty hard to get the back panel off. i think that's cause im weak tho, overall, no complaints. i dont mind the molex connectors, they are pretty easy to connect to the power supply. would recommend this case.",
      "I like the look of this case and it was easy to build with. One thing that I didnt like about the case but not really the case its self it was the 2 front case fans it come with, they has molex power connectors. It was very inconvient to add a molex power cord just for the 2 fans. If they came with a 3 or 4 pin fan connector it would have been easier with cable managment.",
      "Good not great budget case, cable management can be fairly difficult. Especially with the HDD tray which is not removeable (unless you somehow cut it out). Get a modular PSU if you use this case. You can make a non-modular PSU work, but it's a bit tricky and crowded.\nWith this case you do get three fans. Airflow is very nice, and the fans are quiet.\nThe CPU power connector has BARELY any room to reach the motherboard. This was the most difficult part of my build. (Top left of the image provided)\nOverall It's a good budget case that you can make work with some extra effort. But I'd highly recommend looking at some other options.\nUPDATE: 7 months later and after another successful build, PICK A DIFFERENT CASE. There are other MUCH better budget cases out there.",
      "Great airflow, looks good, comes with case fans and all the screws with easy to follow key for which screws go where. I'm giving it 4 stars because it didn't come with a tool to put the mobo pegs/legs/idk the name for them but its the little things that the mobo sits on and the screw goes through it and the mobo into the back of the case. I had to go out and find the tool to screw it in which is very hard because pretty much nowhere has it at the tiny size you need. Also, the front case fans have a molex cord instead of 3 pin so you might need to buy a converter.",
      "some placement of the screws didn't fit with the mobo (i'm sure whenever i bought the case and the mobo it fit but ig it didn't fit in so smoothly) so the mobo as of rn is not screwed in all the way, great air flow and doesn't get that dusty, the front gets dusty though but its easy to clean.",
      "I think this is a great case for the price, I like the way it looks and I haven't had any issues",
      "Great looking case that comes with 3 built in fans, also is about $50 which is a great price."

      "Cute case, I love it! Purchased from amazon and the case comes with a manufactured warranty. I use the cloth for my glasses to wipe away smudges. Has a cool compartment to store two thin HDD in the back that gave enough room for SATA cables. Super sleek, love the way my air cooler and RAM reflects off of the glass! I used regular case fans, 120 mm; I didn't like their RBG fans, so I purchased it without them. Everything fits perfectly. Love the hidden power supply, plus I only have three fans (plus the radiator's three fans) installed and it has been very cool in there.\nInstallation guide is ONLINE btw!",
      "I thought I would like the 6500X, but that thing was HUGE! I did not even consider the 3500X until I saw it in person. This thing has a ton of space for you to work with, and wire management was extremely easy. The glass is also crystal clear, and all the panels feature a pop-off type of connector so you can be inside the PC adjusting things within seconds.",
      "fish tank look cool, many different spots to put a fan, detachable air filters for easy cleaning. Yes this one is good enough",
      "I absolutely love this case. It just looks clean, it's very high quality, AND it has built-in vertical mounting. All you'd need to get is a riser cable and vertical mounting would be available to you.",
      "Great case but not big enough to support fans underneath my 2nd gpu (bottom PCIe 16xslot)",

      "For my first time building, this was an amazing case to build in. Hand screws for the panels and for the PCIe rails were a godsend. Has 3 fans included and installed (1 exhaust fan at the back and 2 intake fans at the front) which saved me an extra bit of money. Lots of room for expansion and a lovely 5.25\" bay which was half the reason I chose this case (Fair warning though, the cover for this bay is attached with weak magnets so expect to deal that cover falling off occasionally from minimal nudges). You will not regret choosing this case if you are starting out!",
      "Very nice case for a first build, only issue I had was the length of the chassis fan cables were very short and barely reached to the headers on the motherboard. I ended up getting an extender to enable me to tidy the cabling.",
      "Awesome case. Nice size. Super easy to build in and work inside. Comes with 2 120mm intake front fans and one 120mm exhaust rear fan. Fans are quiet and work well. Would definitely recommend as a budget, beginner case.",
      "Nice looking case, and great value considering i got mine for $49.99. The Pre-Installed fans get a bit noisy under load, but i can't notice it with my (non-noise cancelling) headphones on. Also, the fan daisy chaining is nice considering the fan header 1 at the bottom of the mobo was a pain to connect to (kept getting too taut while installing the GPU)",
      "No frills case, with good airflow.\nSpace for cable management is rather limited though.\nUsb C should have been included.",
      "Pretty great setup: large enough that mouting the motherboard is pretty easy and the included drive mounts are great. The only issues is that the cable management area is pretty small/thin so I have to push the panel into place and the 5.25\" bay is a little too small. I had to really smash my Icydock 3.5\" HDD bay into the mounting bracket. It works, but fits a littler uncomfortably. The included storage tray in the 5.25\" bay is a fantastic feature though.\nI also think it sucks that you have to buy the type-c cable separater.",

      "mine came with missing parts (second hand), but looks clean",
      "My favorite PC case I've ever seen. Sleek and modern design that still holds up 6 years after its release! My only complaint is the complete lack of airflow, but I see that NZXT has fixed this with the later models.",
      "Looks great, but the airflow is eh. Wish I waited a bit longer for the H5 to come out or just bought the Elite model. A top pick of the 2020s but shouldn't be purchased nowadays.",
      "Seems like a solid case as far as construction, features/thoughtfulness, and finish goes. With one main oversight: the intake and therefore overall airflow. I cut a hole in the front, and I'm not sure how you'd install intake fans otherwise (you need the access for the screwdriver).",
      "Bad mounting spots for an AIO, they should've added another mounting spot at the top for another fan or 240ml AIO... Lacks airflow but has decent cablemanagement.",
      "While it was a little crammed to work with, it still offers relatively good airflow and it has all of the space needed.",
      "Ehhh.... airflow is fine, price is fine, case is good, but I would recommend the H510 Flow if I could do it again. Or the H510i as that comes with RGB",
      "A good tower that's easy to manage and has high-quality materials used.",
      "Definitely would recommend the mesh version. The 2x120 fans are nice even if they aren't exactly quiet at lower speeds, and only move about as much air as the 120 from my previous computer (at a much lower sound level though)"

      "My dream case. Before I got this I had the King 65 Pro, great case but once I saw that I didn't need the ARGB hub that came with the case anymore I pulled the trigger on this.",
      "Love this case! Chose it over a lot of other dual chamber/fish tank case mostly because it can fit 140mm fans on the bottom, side, and top, however you're limited to a single 120mm for the rear. RGB looks great, however it is kind of annoying the it doesn't remember your last setting when you start the PC up. I have to cycle the RGB modes to put it back into the state I had it before. Minor inconvenience, not the end of the world. Haven't tried using any 3rd part software to control the case RGB yet.",
      "This is one of my favorite looking cases on the market. Cable managment was a breeze and the all white cords was an asthetically pleasing touch. Only complaint is I wish the RGB was customizable with an app as opposed to buttons on the case.",
      "Premium build quality, RGB front panel, tempered glass, spacious design, excellent airflow and cable management, supports custom liquid cooling loops.",
      "Such a great case, so big and has lots of little slots to slide the cables through. Case comes with little velcro straps and built in metal bars to make cable management a breeze. The RGB lights have different modes, super clean.",
      "Very clear with the tolerances as far as the MOBO positioning allows as far as compatibility with other parts. The AIO does not fit with the board in the upper position. The manual also does not mention compatibility with the board in the lower position. With 140mm fans at the bottom, cords plugging into the bottom of the MOBO have to squeeze between the board and the fans and then have to sit at a tight bend/angle. Otherwise great case. Lots of fan mounts. Wish the rubber grommets were white and not gray but it's not that noticeable with RGB on. Massive space behind the MOBO and velcro loops for cough cough cord management cough cough. Lost those pictures that I definitely took....",
      "This case is so easy to build in, I love how quick it is to remove any panels on the outside of the case. Tons of room in the back to manage cables, and it is great how they included some cable routing channels to hold power cords then smaller cables with the included velcro ties. Only thing I would note is that if you are mounting your motherboard in the upper position (like I did), to make sure that any HDMI/Display port cables you use are fairly slim around the connector to the GPU. The upper position does not leave much room between the back of the case and the GPU slot to attach your display cables."

      "I really enjoy this case! Great airflow. Sort of hard to build in, maybe it was my screwdriver (I doubt it) but some of the screws wouldn't come undone, I was able to work around it but it was definitely inconvenient. Plenty spacious in my opinion though, it wasn't hard to build in space-wise. I ended up going with this one because I like mesh cases and I enjoyed that it came with a fan as well",
      "Choice for me was between Asus AP201 and Lian-Li A3. Both have basically the same internal layout. I chose the Asus because it was slightly larger (and hopefully easier to work in) and because it has a mesh front cover. Well built. Good quality components. Very happy with my choice.\nAs an all-mesh case, it does let sound through. I tried another PSU, but I went back to my favorite: a beQuiet Straight Power 11 550w platinum that I pulled from another build. This thing is basically silent. With the case fans running slowly, I can barely hear it even though it's sitting right next to me.",
      "Great case to work in, some clever design choices and I'm quite fond of the mesh panels. I wish they'd made provisions for 3 fans at the bottom of the case though.",
      "Love almost everything about the case, to the toolless panels, to the airflow, to the GPU clearance, too much to talk about, only problem was the cable management in the back, lack of space didn't help at all especially with a fan hub.\nIf I could choose a different case I would've chose the Lian Li Dan A3 Wood Edition or the Jonsbo Z20",
      "Excellent in build quality, design and usability. Easy to route cables around, offers lots of tie-down points on the backside. Love the screw-less body panes that are easy to remove and reattach.\nThe case layout allows for various airflow setups, and it's probably very forgiving in case you design something bad thanks to its mesh sides all around.\nLooks great with subtle RGB inside, in my opinion mesh with soft diffused light coming through it looks much better than window sides.",
      "Great mATX case, a bit larger than I would've hoped for, but great for a beginner like I was when I first did this build.",
      "Amazing compact case, the cable management is tough though",
      "LOVE this case. super spacious while keeping the microATX size, great cable management, easily one of my favorites.",
      "Great, it is a bit small for cable management but overall I really like it and its minimalist design",
      "great case if you want to get away from bigger, glassier cases. it sucks dust and is noisier if you have noisier fans because of it being entirely perforated but its good for what you want if this is what you want!"

      "Love this case. Simple, easy to use, so much ventilation. Only thing that’s not ideal is the top mounted usb ports.\nThere were some other sff cases that I liked but this was such good value without potentially being really difficult to build in.",
      "Best case ever, shame they don't produce it anymore :)",
      "Old case but probably still the best budget SFF offering out there. Easy to build in, high quality, great price. Front panel IO is a bit outdated, but I don't need the latest USB standards anway.",
      "Great case, even a first time pc builder like me can get around it pretty intuitively. Using an SFX-L PSU means you must use slim fans for the top. However, the fan mounting hardware specifically for the top of the case only accommodate standard thickness fans. To get around this, I had to use the rubber hdd mounting rings provided in the case to make the mounts work with the slim fans.",
      "nice case to work in but wouldn’t recommend for first build",
      "a great low cost mini itx case, that is still easy to build in.",
      "Good case, I guess. The build quality and finish on this case are very nice and premium. It's fairly compact. The vertical GPU mount or AIO positions are not the best, maybe a bit more thought and this case would have been a home run. Cooler clearance could have been maybe 5-7mm higher, but it's alright.",
      "I used the Zalman M2 Mini case.",
      "the best case i ever had. u can mod this little turd to your hearts content and going crazy",
      "Not the smallest SFF case but for a first build I wanted to have enough room to build my PC and also accommodate a larger GPU down the line if needed. I wish there was an aluminum option to this but it's still a decent looking case in black. Right now I don't really use USB-C but if you do it could get annoying with no front port."

      "This is an excellent case with some great quality of life features. There's a little door on the back once you take off the back panel that helps you hide your cables, and I really like the top and front dust filters. There's also a removable dust filter for the PSU. I find that the inside of my case doesn't get all that dusty, so the filters really do work. The build quality is also excellent, with tight tolerances for the side panels that help them go on and off more easily than a lot of lower-priced cases, and the PCIe slot covers aren't flimsy like you might find on a cheaper case. The front I/O is pretty solid, though not as amazing in 2025 as it was in 2022.\nOn the negative side, there are only two included, non-RGB fans, which feels pretty bad at >$150. It's also, you know, over $150, when you can get a perfectly competent ATX tower for $65 or so with only a few compromises. I recently built in the Phanteks XT Pro, acquired for $65, and while it was worse than this case, it wasn't only 1/3 as good. It was probably 70% as good, for 40% of the price.\nMy conclusion would be that I really love this case, but I don't love the price or the stinginess on included fans, so despite its excellent build quality and builder-friendly features, you should probably find another case that provides better price-to-performance unless money is no object to you.",
      "A carry-over from my previous build; I just love this case because it's got plenty of room for all kinds of upgrades and I can see myself keeping it for over a decade, plenty of airflow and the dust filters really put in work.",
      "Super easy to build in as a first timer. Gets a little tight with 10 RGB fans needing wired in but it all fit in the end.",
      "Huge",
      "Overall good the only issue is the front panel io is just a bunch 2 pins and not just one big cable to go in",
      "I hoped to move from a 4000D Airflow to the 5000D Airflow but I was on the wrong way, it's Corsair cases that no longer suit me. Building in this 5000D Airflow is a real pain, here is why :\nCable management was not the easiest because there is little space to put cables at the back of the case, it's even worse if you have custom extensions like me.\nToo many removable parts but you can't easily remove them for the side fans for example, it's really annoying\nThe little removable door behind the case is ridiculously useless, in addition to being annoying to put back, it's just useless.\nPutting an AIO on top is super annoying, it can make certain AIOs incompatible with certain motherboard VRM heatsinks because the top of the case is not high enough compared to the motherboard, the fans can also pass in front of the Q-Code of the motherboard, which can be annoying, plus it will crush your CPU Power cable 100%, poorly designed\nIn conclusion, it was a \"beautiful\" case but poorly designed for comfort of use, plus, the second front USB port was unstable with a bluetooth keyboard.",
      "Very convenient case, incredibly sturdy and well-built, for the price, you seriously cannot go wrong with either this or the 4000D in terms of sheer quality of material.",
      "Super easy case to work with and build in! a bit overpriced",
      "An absolute dream to build in! Has great cable management and provides plennntyyy of airflow! For a mid tower case, it's massive, especially compared to my previous NZXT S340 elite which was a nice size, it is a very roomy and heavy case but definitely worth it for the amount of fans that this can fit and if you like the roomy aesthetic.\nOnly con of mine is that the side glass panel has quite a heavy tint on it and dumbs down the rgb but that does lend to the aesthetic of this case and my build.",
      "The case looks great, has a ton of dust filters that are easy to access, and has many options for building.\nThe biggest issue I had was the space for the CPU cables at the top with a radiator was not adequate. I bought spacers for my front and top radiator (the front was fine but it looks better to match the top) to space it away enough to just barely get the cables to not be crushed. This can be less of an issue for other motherboards with a different spot for the cables.\nAnother issue was partially an issue with the motherboard but the 2 cutouts with grommets for cables do not align with the 24 pin and I had to either bend the cables up or down around 60 degrees.\nFor an AIO or air-cooled system this is a great case, but watercooling was challenging. There is a good amount of room for cables but the way I routed my tubes for cooling took a lot of space away from behind the power supply. I would give it a 4.5 if I could because most issues were avoidable with more planning."

      "When looking for a case for my build I was looking for a all white fish tank case with good air flow that's when I came across the h6 flow which due to its 3 angled side fans which come with the case it offers good airflow with amazing viewing angles Inside the case. The case it's self is easy to build in and keep tidy due to its dual chamber to hide and messy cables.",
      "Aesthetic based case. There are better options but this is nice because the cable management is good and the fans don't need to be switched out - they can perform! The overall design also gives it good airflow because my PC has never exceeded 70°C. It is on the pricier side imo.",
      "Coming from an almost decade-old NZXT S340 Elite, I was surprised to see how many new QoL features have been packed into these modern cases. Great building experience.",
      "great case to build in and is very roomy in the back. also looks extremely good",
      "airflow is topnotch, havent faced any overheating with this case and if you have the correct fan orientation and placement it should be amazing for you too.",
      "The NZXT H6 Flow RGB ATX Mid Tower is a solid case. It looks great and has good airflow, but using the RGB connectors can be a bit of a hassle. I added two NZXT F140 fans and one F120 fan, and it all came together nicely.",
      "love this case and its aesthetic",
      "Looks great, the fans that come with it aren't my favorite but you can easily swap them out for other ones. The dual chamber makes it easy to mash your cabl-manage your cables well.",
      "looks great but overpriced",
      "Great Case with Awesome air flow. If you want to see video of it search for it on Youtube. Found a guy showing the air flow that was pretty awesome. Wish the RGB fans had more pigtails to add the bottom fans to them. Paid $135 from Micro Center."

      "Great case. Fractal Design paid attention to every little detail and it shows. Fits a Noctua NH-U14S and a 3080. Comparing this to a Fractal Design Refine series, the Meshify is quieter at high load when the fans are going crazy (due to the improved airflow) but the Refine is quieter at idle and blocks random noises better.",
      "A pleasure to build in and look at.",
      "Elegant and simple case with a unique design for the front grill. Ample vents make cooling easy. My only qualm with it is that there are no USB-C outlets in the front connectors.",
      "YES YES YES. This case is perfect. Easy cable management, filters keep everything out while sucking all the air in, fun to work in, and surprisingly beautiful if your not a fan of rgb.",
      "I've used this case for a few years now and it has done me well. Easy to build in, quality construction, nice design choices. It does a great job at not letting much dust in, but the dust filter in front is difficult to clean once it's caught a bunch of dust. I would recommend Fractal Design cases every day of the week.",
      "Solid case. Comes with 2 pre-installed 120mm fans (not PWM), has great cable management options with the pre-installed velcro straps, and has a nice fixture that holds up to three 2.5\" drives in the back.\nHaven't upgraded the fans at all, aside from adding an old 90mm fan I had laying around to the front, and airflow and temps are perfect.\nThe one annoying thing about this case is taking the tempered side panel off, but that's not really an issue once you're done building.",
      "I've been using this tower for 4 years now - I've been so happy with it that I've chosen to upgrade in-place instead of switch towers. The airflow is superb and the size is just right (fits my 3080, Noctua NH-D15, and fans without issue).\nOne day I'll probably need to change cases to fit the new longer graphics cards and because I'll front USB-C in the front-panel, but I love this case.",
      "Plenty of space for chassis fans. This case is very efficient with its use of space and makes a great midsize case for most builds. I like the geometric pattern on the front and appreciate all the intake filters.",
      "Legendary chassis. A bit smaller than your average ATX mid tower. It’s been surpassed by newer models as of 2023 IMO.",
      "I love how the case looks and the airflow is amazing. I do not like how you have to take out the driver bay to use 3 120mm fans in the front. I wish there was a bit more space for cable management."

      "The case looks great. The picture makes it look like the front's light grey, when in person it seems more black/dark grey. Shouldn't be an issue unless you're planning a greyscale build. The side panel's hinged, which is great since I am constantly opening it and admiring my handiwork. Plenty of room for the PSU, plenty of passthroughs for cables, plenty of room in the back. I do have some small issues, which contributed to this case losing a star. The first one is the front panel. It is. So hard. To remove. There's a handle thing at the bottom, and you need to yank it, but I was half convinced it couldn't come off at all. It took 2 people after half an hour of trying to finally take it off. I had a similar problem with removing the HDD cage, but I could fit cables around it so that's okay. The HD Audio and the Front Panel USB have ketchup and mustard cables, but I don't really notice so it's fine. The stock fan is pretty loud, so I recommend buying some separately. The case came with plenty of screws and zip ties, so cable management was pretty easy. The airflow seems good, so overall would recommend for the more minimal aesthetic.",
      "A very good case for its budget.\nCable management: As a first time builder, I can say you have plenty of headroom. Managed to organize all the cables without any issue.\nCables: Too bad that near the connector you have to see all the wires, kinda ruins the aesthetic. If you don't mind it then you shouldn't worry.",
      "Lots of room for tall CPU coolers and large GPUs",
      "Got this for $60 US. Comes with Hinged side panel and the front IO on mine was a little rough when it came to me but was perfectly fine from that. Good to build in and comes with Screws. Like a lot of screws for Fans, PSU mounting, and Motherboard mounting.",
      "Very good and cheap case with more than enough space for mATX. Comes with a pre-installed 120 mm fan on the back. Enough space for cable management and storage. The max PSU length on the website is wrong tho, mine is 162 mm and fits easily, I guess you could even fit a 180 mm in there.",
      "Oh boi! For 65$, its an AMAZING Case. I had worst bulding experience and more expensive Case. Cable management is a piece of cake, especially if you are using a Modular /Semi Modular PSU with only SSDs\nAirflow is actually good, i love the TG door"

      "Amazing looking case. Parts needs to be researched extensivly if they fit in all dimensions, especially ram, GPU and CPU cooler clearance. The alluminim case does accumulate heat in its skeleton and center core over time, so performance can degrade if build is closed up with bad cable management.",
      "This was simply eye catching and I knew that I must have it as my mITX case. It looks and feels premium. Conveniently FFVI is my favorite RPG so I picked up an adornment to place on the front after completing the build.\nMy experience in building with this was straightforward and easy. My CPU cooler and GPU choices (53mm/50mm) allowed for a lot of wiggle room in the spine so I ended up leaving it set at 4 (62mm/58mm).\nIt should be noted that due to the increased fitment variability with the ability to adjust the spine of the case, there may be some quirks when leveraging PC Part Picker's compatibility filter or seeing warnings related to the CPU cooler and/or GPU in relation to this case. The clearances table in the manual would be your best guide to ensuring clearances of various combinations of CPU coolers and GPUs.",
      "It's so fun to open and close this case. It feels so premium and it looks nice. Relatively easy to build in, but hoping that it has more space to run more fans.",
      "Somehow an easier case to build in than any ATX mid tower I had built in previously. Gorgeous aesthetics, premium build quality, and a wide range of cooler and GPU support for an ITX.",
      "Delighted withy choice of the Terra. I'd considered the NR200, AP201 and Dan A4-H20 but have no regrets. It looks great, was easy to build in, has acceptable thermals and noise levels with my components and feels very well manufactured and premium.",
      "No complaints whatsoever! Super easy to work in, rock-solid, beautifully made, looks fantastic, and gives loads of flexibility. This thing was the spark that ignited my whole build—I couldn't be happier with it!",
      "Pros\nLooks great and quite unusual\nVery solid, feels well made\nFantastic manual/documentation\nExcellent compatibility info on their site\nEasy to build in as 3 sides are completely removable\nCons\nExpensive\nSignificantly reduced choice in components by selecting this case\nNo dust filters due to lack of clear in/out panels, probably going to accumulate a lot of dust (I did put aftermarket filters on the underside)\nVery limited front panel connectors\nProbably quite easy to build something with cooling issues\nDespite listing a configuration for a 120mm AIO liquid cooler, this seems impractical for most (probably almost all) users\nDespite listing compatibility with SFX-L PSUs I'm not sure I'd want to use one here as it would likely rule out a bottom case fan\nLists 322mm as maximum graphics card length but my 320mm was flush against the power cable",
      "Love from the first sight, not that hard to build in. Just follow builds here and do your math.",
      "Amazing case, very easy to build in, but feels like some space was wasted at the top of the case where exhaust fans could've been placed.",
      "I really like the aesthetics of this case. It was really easy to build in and cable management was smooth. As long as you plan ahead and measure out your parts to make sure what you need, it should be a breeze. The adjustable spine makes it easy to have combination with multiple cpu cooler and gpu's."

      "I initially had the Zalman P30, but I wasn’t a fan of the large PSU chamber at the bottom, so I swapped to the Lian Li A3. It’s an amazing case with lots of part compatibility, but you need to research clearance for your parts. One issue I ran into was that stock cables on ATX sized PSUs are really long, which made cable management a huge pain. Later, I bought a used PSU and got custom cables.",
      "Includes all the parts for basically every conceivable configuration in the box. The parts are a tight fit but it seems good so far. Also the panels come off really easy.",
      "I love this case. It's small, but not too small where you have to make many compromises. I am using an SFX power supply with it, though I don't see any need to invest in one if you don't have one already. One issue I did have was that my SFX cpu 8-pin was too short to reach the port on the motherboard. However, this isn't really a fault of the case and is easily remedied with extensions/custom cables. I see a lot of complaints about cable management. I would agree that this is a far cry from most dual chamber cases where you can cram your sins into the second chamber and forget what you have done. I would also agree there isn't the typical amount of tie down points. That being said, I am typically bad at cable management, yet I think I was able to get a clean result. Zip ties, 15 minutes and a dream is all you need.",
      "My first experience in the small case game. It looks good and i actually had room to spare with my oversized PSU.",
      "Only complaint is the white version had a solid front panel. *If you are adding bottom fans, be sure to install the MOBO with the front panel connectors already installed first. If you install the bottom fans before you install the MOBO, you will not be able to reach the bottom of the MOBO headers. No where to cable manage behind MOBO, but you can't see into the case anyways.",
      "Cable management was a process but other than that the case is nice. I picked up the glass side panel and maybe will buy a custom front panel.",
      "Probably the most disappointing piece of my build, I love the all mesh look, and its long enough for a 360mm AIO, but wish it had front ventilation as well as any place for cable management, as this case has no dedicated space for it.",
      "I bought this case for my birthday (Oct. 2024) because I was thinking of downsizing my atx build but didn't want to spend extra money on itx parts or a new cooler since most itx cases I liked only fit a 240mm aio. It was between this or the Asus AP201 but I have been a big fan of Lian Li cases (I had the O11 Dynamic razer edition, and the Lancool 216) that I knew I had to get the new a3 case. It adequately fits all of my parts while being significantly smaller than any of the cases I have ever owned. Thermals in this case a perfect where my gpu idles at 30 C and my cpu idles at 45-50 C (due to the Intel Turbo Boost).",
      "Great affordable case, wish it did come with a glass panel included but I will buy it when it becomes available in Australia. Airflow is great, and the main complaint would be the lack of fan filters due to an all mesh design. I will see if dust becomes an issue later on."

      "This case rocks. Little hidden compartment! Good airflow! Nice RGB fans! This was my first build so building in a mATX case was tough, but I got it done. Cable management is okay, but its a small case so that was to be expected.",
      "Fractal Design is a brand that’s always been talked about, starting with the Define R5 in 2014. Since then, it’s always seemed minimalistic and with a very nice style.\nI looked for mATX options and found this one. It seemed very \"straightforward\" and aesthetic. I’m not a big fan of RGB, but in white, it gives a \"less extravagant\" look.\nI didn’t connect the 3 fans to the system where they can be controlled by a button, and instead, I connected them to the motherboard. Also, I don’t use the 3.0 USB ports, which is why you don’t see the connector on the motherboard, and the 3.0 Type-C comes separately, which is something many people complain about. I’m waiting for it to arrive since it sells out quickly.",

      "Great looking case with nice fans and lots of room in basement to stuff psu cables",
      "Easy to build in, not too big, and actually has disc bays. Best case that I've used so far, and its not too expensive either.",
      "Pros: - Looks great - Pretty good airflow and radiator/fan support - Built-in RGB controller Cons\" - Terrible build quality - Front panel USB-C sold separately?? - Misaligned mobo standoffs - no dust filter for front panel I've used Fractal cases before and have loved building in them, but cannot recommend this one. It was a complete nightmare to build in, and the glass side panel screws keep coming out despite being captive."

      "Great looking case, love the handle. Made for LAN parties.",
      "One of the best invention Deepcool has ever created. The price is competitive, and the quality is remarkable. Although would love to see Deepcool change the side panels screws with thumb screws for easy panel removal/installation.",
      "Great case, accessible to build in and assemble. The top handle is removable, looks much better without it. Front gathers dust quite quickly and difficult to clean without removing every panel. I wish removing the panels was easier. The screws that hold them on are small and strip easily. Some cannot be removed without removing every other panel.",
      "Absolutely wonderful case, very easy to work in, and you can fit up to 5 fans in there (I have mine in front intake, top exhaust, push/push on the CPU air cooler, and rear exhaust). Front panel cables are a bit messy and there's really no good place to cable manage but for $65AUD this is an absolute bargain SFF case.",
      "From the moment I laid eyes on the CH160, I knew it was the perfect case for my project, and I have to say, it exceeded all my expectations in every way. As someone who was building a PC for the first time, I was a bit nervous about the assembly process. However, the CH160 made everything so much easier. The interior layout is incredibly well thought out, providing ample space for cable management, which was a huge relief. The modular design allowed me to route cables efficiently, keeping everything tidy and optimizing airflow. The case’s design really helped make the build process smooth and stress-free, which is something I truly appreciated as a first-time builder. The tempered glass side panel is a highlight, providing a perfect view of the internal components, and it pairs beautifully with RGB lighting, making the entire setup look stunning. The glass is clear and sturdy, showcasing the components and lighting effects without any distortion.\nI chose this case because it struck a great balance between compactness and design. The design is sleek and modern and the glass side panel adds a nice touch, allowing a clear view of the build inside. The compact size of the case was a crucial factor, as we wanted something that would fit comfortably on her desk without overwhelming the space. I’m extremely pleased with how everything came together in this case. At the same time I am very sorry for everyone in the US who are not able to buy this case because of the China import ban :-("

      "Absolutely stunning, it's a massive case but if you have the parts to fill it out there's nothing to beat it. Very easy to build in, I would recommend not putting the rad up top. I put mine on the side with intake fans on it and have had zero problems with that setup.",
      "It's a good clean case. Kind of large but if you are fine with that it's a good choice.",
      "Nice case but very heavy due to glass panels. Would have been nice if 4th fan was also rgb. Screws are of low quality most of them won’t fit straight but the real issue was motherboard mounting screws, 3 of them had defective threads only one was available as spare. Waiting for spare to be received. Although the case looks huge but the Asus rog z790 hero motherboard fits very tight sadly on the top. Very hard to connect top power cables plus bending and then arctic freezer ii 360 fits very tight."

      "Fantastic case to build a PC in! Has so much room which makes it easy to build in. Has space for up to 12 fans, the airflow is great and space for storage is great too if you are someone in need of lots of storing. The case is high quality and heavy, has a very sturdy feel to it!",
      "Lots of space to do whatever you could dream of. Nice mounting points for the cables round the back.",
      "Absolutely amazing case to work in. It is huge, heavy, and I wouldn't give it up for the world. Extra points for a built in fan controller.",
      "Favorite case I have ever used, check out my full build and see my silly cats and why I appreciate this case has really good dust filters to limit what cat hair gets in there as best as it can. Secondly this fits EVERYTHING including an Arctic Liquid Freezer 3 with Lian Li AL120V2 Fans with an overall height of 66mm, it had extra space in fact below that. I also really appreciated the hinged doors, removable fan and radiator mounts in the front, side and top as well as the excellent cable management, the best I have dealt with. If you want big with space for anything you can imagine (including possible future custom loop builds) this is the best case to get. Easy 5 Stars, Yes its heavy, but thats part of the fun.",
      "Very nice case, love the modular nature of it and the hinged front and back doors. Very good airflow.",
      "Look, I love Corsair cases. My first PC had a 400C, and this is well built with a lot of useful goodies included. But I hate it’s size, it’s what I paid for but good lord I hate it so much. My arms aren’t long enough to carry it right, I’m not holding a $3000+ PC at a 45 degree angle. Please, only buy this if you run Dual 4090’s watercooled or something MENTAL. You will break your back and be angry while at it.",
      "So much Space Bought like 3 of these case and most of the cable management is already done for you. 8x120mm fans or 3 140's 4x120mm airflow airflow all the way",
      "Well built but very very heavy and not wide enough for my water cooled GPU",
      "Big space for everything you need and the airflow is mindblowing. You have enough space for your drink to put it in there and cool it. (JK but you can try :D)",
      "The case is massive so be prepared to have a large space to put it, it has very easy side panels which open like a door and close easily, it has a mesh to keep dust out of the fans and has a fan hub, it is really easy to clean the dust filters since the front panel and top panel detach with a little bit of pull, the one thing I did not realize while getting this cases was that on most of every motherboard you get, you will not be able to use 2 of the USBs on the top, so you will have an extra cable or two hanging around, there are tons of drive bays but one of them you cant use unless you have really good cable management."

      "Sleak, good airflow, easy to work with.",
      "Great to build in, its quite a bit smaller than h9 btw. Cable management is ok. the aio was kinda hard to install in this but that's because its a 360mm",
      "Dual chamber at this price is solid value but the included fans are a mess.",
      "Spectacular case. Plenty of airflow. Plenty of space at the back to throw all my cables",
      "Definitely my favourite case, a little bit hard to work with if you're using strimer cables. Also quite difficult to cable manage in the back, but could just be me lmao",
      "Great case for my upcoming third build I'm working on, keeps really cool if you can set up proper airflow inside, but be wary of trying to use the Corsair RX fans and any others that use similar wiring cause the bottom where the 140mm fans go have a sort of lip that makes it impossible to attach the wiring to it.",
      "looks super cool has lots of space and wire management things but you would have to buy and rgb controller for the leds on the fans which i didnt realise until after i made my pc",
      "The case itself is great, easy to build in, and makes cable manegment easy, however, while the inbuilt case fans are high quailty and quite, i payed $20 extra for RGB just for 2/3 of the fans to have broken RGB pins, this is probably a issue with the seller though, so take this with a grain of salt",
      "It looks amazing and has great airflow but it is kinda fat.",
      "Beautiful case and very easy to work with - big fan. Having the front fans offset diagonally at the back is a genius design, and I love the fact you can set fans into the bottom of the case for a very clean and tidy look (though slight gripe that you can only put 140mm fans in there, and I've heard that the 140mm Lian Li SL infinity fans don't quite fit in there without some modding - something to be aware of).\nIf using an AIO do check whether the radiator/fan thickness fall within NZXT's stated tolerance for this case otherwise you might find your fans sit very close to (or touch the top of) the motherboard. I'm using the Deepcool LT720 and the radiator is quite slim so no issues there."

      "The Fractal North XL is a great case to build in. Cable management space is adequate, and there is plenty of room in the basement for the inevitable extra cables.\nThe side intake fan on the mesh is well designed, has holes for passing fan cables through, and able to be mounted at different heights, secured with two thumbscrews off the back. All fan mounts are either 120mm or 140mm, including the aforementioned side intake. The side panels have a small wobble to them, but do not feel like they will permanently bend by just removing them. An extra side panel at the front can be removed with a well placed thumbscrew, and a slide back to make the front fans, or a radiator much easier to install. This doubles as a shroud to cover the radiator and keep a cleaner looking build. Top panel is tool free with a small piece of leather to grip. Just slide it back and it comes free with ease. The front can take a little force, but pull on the actual bottom and it will come free, giving full access to the front fan mounts. My only concern is that the thumbscrews feel a little rough to turn in. It feels as though you are threading a screw with rough threads into a hole with fine threads. They do tighten down well, by hand, and remain secure.\nMounting the hardware into the case is straightforward, with a removable and movable HDD cage in the bottom to allow for different PSU options. The bottom intake is filtered with a removable filter out the bottom back part of the case. The top is also vented so if you prefer to mount your PSU fan up, there is no issue with it being able to breathe. This was very nice for me using the Lian Li Edge Power Supply.\nThe motherboard and GPU go in and line up easily, I did not have any fans installed, but they should be well out of the way if you do. The cabling guides are spacious and will balanced to make cable management simple and straightforward. The vented bottom is rigid enough to hand most anti sag devices, and if using the side intake, you won't need to worry about putting fans in the bottom, although this is possible.\nFor fans, and radiators, Fractal gave us all of the options by spacing the mesh in a way to be compatible with nearly any fan. There is even an option to mount a small fan as an extra intake below most GPU's using the PCIE covers. The back mesh will easily hold a 140MM fan with choice of placement, a little higher, or lower, and even a bit of side to side play.\nOverall, this is a well thought out, and reliably built case, I will definitely recommend Fractal Design cases to anyone looking.",
      "Stunning case, easy to build in, the preinstalled fans are quiet, there's plenty of space for cable management, its overall good looking and the side fan bracket is chefs kiss. The only problem I had was that there could have been a better selection of screws for mounting AIOs and other parts.",
      "Generally speaking, this was a very easy build, partly aided by generous internal space, pre-routed cables and well-placed cable ties. The thumbscrews on the case felt cemented on and had to be undone with a screwdriver. With usage, they do loosen up more easily.",
      "Very roomy. Has multiple Velcro cable ties for cable management. Along with the multiple cable management holes and cable tie slots, it makes cable management a breeze.\nThe version with the mesh side panel also has a side fan mount, which I used for extra Noctua intake fans. It also comes with three 140 mm PWM fans pre-installed in the front of the case for intake, which are quiet enough. Combined with the fact that this case is very roomy, this makes airflow not a problem at all."

      "The SAMA ARGB-Q5 is pretty solid for a budget case, though it definitely shows in some places, like thin, cheap-feeling metal paneling, the flex-off PCIe covers, and plastic thumbscrews. But it also has some really nice features that you wouldn't expect, like 3 fully addressable RGB fans with a fan hub and actual tempered glass side panel. It also has fantastic airflow, easily removable front and side panels, (somewhat) filtered intake for the PSU, and decent cable management holes. For MSRP (60$), it's a strong contender. For the price I got it at (30$ new!), it was a no-brainer.",

      "The Antec C5 ARGB was a great deal for about $122 USD. It's probably the best deal you can get for a case like this. It comes with 3x 120mm PWM REVERSE BLADE fans on the side, 3x 120mm PWM REVERSE BLADE fans on the bottom, and a normal PWM 120mm fan on the back. The fans are quiet and overall temps have been better than I expected. It also comes with a preinstalled fan and ARGB (5v) hub with headers for 8 total fans.\nThe only small issue I had with this case was the cable management was not the best. The fan wires were a mess and had to be re-routed to clean them up but it wasn't too bad. Overall I highly recommend this case! You can't beat it at this price point for what you get.",
      "Great case, super spacious, and a BUNCH of fans. (Over 9 of them.)",
      "Nice-looking case if you like things that glow.\nAllows for excellent cooling\nCould be improved with dress panels to cover cable channels once assembled\nIf using a full-size ATX board, the bottom fans interfere with installation of PCIe power, audio, and front panel headers. You need to remove fans before installing the board and then reinstall the fans",
      "amazing case, looks amazing and the fans look really good and perform good. the tempered glass looks really clean. it is also actually cheap case bc it comes with 7 argb fans. the only really tiny thing I would change is to hide the open space where the motherboard 24 pin cable goes it just looks weird from the side but thats really it perfect case.",
      "Its a lovely case, so easy to build in, the fans are reversable and you get a hub with it. I do always rewire the case when I use it as they never wire correctly from factory. It looks amazing as well highly recommend"

      "For the case, I went with the Antec Flux Pro. After watching Gamer Nexus's review of it, I was convinced that it was the next case for me. So far, I have been very impressed with the cooling abilities of the case. It has insane airflow and build quality with a lot of cool features. However, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who wants a very silent build, especially not if you are running the same number of fans that I am. I have replaced the stock fans of the case with Arctic P12s and P14s: three P14s as intake at the front and one in the back as exhaust, two P12s at the bottom as intake, and then I use the AIO as exhaust.",
      "The only PC case ive ever built into but this thing was an absolute dream to build into and keeps the parts cooled very nicely, there is just so much space to build into and so much thought thats gone into this",
      "Pleased with the build quality, ease of building, and included fans' performance. The fans are not silent, but very quiet. I tried a few different fan models (e.g. Arctic P14 Max) in a different case before choosing the Flux Pro based on reviews. The front panel is very easy to remove to wipe off dust, and all of the major panels are toolless. It's a shame the temperature display on the side requires optional software to run; I don't want to download that.\nMy PSU is mounted in a standard orientation. Not sure how well the default, sideways orientation works.",
      "Brilliantly designed with toolless everything. Every cable hole is placed exactly where it is needed and cable management is excellent. The cooling it brings to the table is also top-notch. A bit on the large size but not too much. For what Antec is offering it is excellently priced as well."

      "I think it goes without saying at this point that the Fractal Design North is a gorgeous case for those who enjoy the wood aesthetic. If you've seen the photos I uploaded of this completed build and are familiar with both of the black and white versions of this case, no, your eyes aren't deceiving you. I was able to swap the front oak panel from the white variant with the walnut panel from the black variant. Both combinations look great, in my opinion, but the walnut complemented the rest of my peripherals better, so I settled on the white/walnut combination. I'm really not sure why Fractal doesn't straight up offer the different variations for the front panel like how you're able to choose either the tempered glass or mesh side panel, as I know it's a pretty popular point of feedback that many North owners have suggested since its release.\nAs far as building in the case itself, apart from working around the oversized EATX motherboard, I found that there was an ample amount of space for all of the parts I selected. Cable management was also fairly straight forward (as seen in my photo with the back panel removed). The case is also great at allowing air to flow through it while idling and utilizing the six case fans while under load, in part thanks to the Fan Control software.",
      "One of the most beautifully designed cases on the market imo. It looks great in my apartment and complements my desk and furniture without screaming GAMER. Fit all of my components just fine, and has enough volume to keep my components cool. I might recommend the XL variant for folks with large hands though, at times it was tough to reach parts of the motherboard after my CPU cooler was installed - although with a bit of planning you could just install things in a more sensible order.",
      "Absolutely beautiful and pretty easy to work in.",
      "My dream PC case. I just love the well-blended aesthetic of wood and tech. Decently priced as well! Fractal has always been my favorite case manufacturer and they continue to do so.",
      "ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS Case\nHides Fans well, thanks to its (polarizing) borders, which I personally like\nthe real wood front panel, soft edges and Mesh make it look like a peace of Furniture, and it blends in really well.\nTemps are great\nCable Management is easy\nGreat air cooling, good airflow, 2 capable 140mm fans included\nIts a bit small, which can be a feature for some, but a headache for others. Thanks to supporting a 280mm Radiator in the Front, combined with a max GPU length of 300mm, it can fit high end hardware, but take those limits into account.",
      "It looks great, and I have a push pull config on it! And yes you can fit a 360mm aio in the front. The build quality isn’t that great imo, the lian li a3 is way better for a fraction of the cost.",
      "You don't need me to review this, it's awesome and you already know it. Lots of little quality of life touches, easy to route cables, looks really smart, stays very cool and seems to have good airflow.",
      "Gorgeous, professional, easy to move, disassemble, etc... This case is just perfect.",
      "A beautiful case that blends aesthetics with functionality. The design is minimalist yet classy, and it provides excellent airflow, especially with the inclusion of multiple fans.",

      "Great airflow (which I couldn't say about NZXT 5 years ago), looks amazing, build quality is top notch, but the highlight: cable management and routing is CLASS LEADING. Amazing to build in, my favourite case to build in thus far in my 6 years of experience building PCs. Smallest gripe: it's kind of scary to to remove glass side panel as it just snaps in with no screws which looks very clean but kind of daunting to remove especially for the first time when I found out it pops out up top then you need to pull up on the glass to remove the bottom. Overall, still an amazing case!",

      "Easy cable management and good cooling temps",
      "Great design that clearly follows NZXT's aesthetic and has all the front I/O ports I could need. The tool-less panels are great. However, I think it is too big to be considered an ATX \"Mid\" Tower. It has great cable management, but it could have more locations for looping zip ties through. The glass panel is also tinted, which I genuinely do not understand as you cannot see anything without some bright RGB lighting. Lastly, the power LED will blink while the computer is in sleep mode, which I found annoying. Thankfully my motherboard had the option to disable it.\nGiving 1 star as NZXT has done some shady practice (see Gamers Nexus for context) and I truly regret buying this case instead of something else.",

      "I really like this case. It has a small footprint, and no major compromises to keep things small. There is a decent amount of space for both the GPU and an SF-L psu.\nOnly thing I would want to improve is to have a more open mesh on the side panels as they are somewhat restrictive and there is no airflow over the back of the GPU.\nIt would also be good (for my build) if I could tie the case fan speeds to GPU temps. The easiest way to do this would probably be with an external temp sensor connected to the motherboard, but unfortunately the board I picked does not support that."

      "Building with this case was effortless. It was chosen for its cooling capabilities and with the number of fans included and could be added, the CPU and GPU cooling is a very effortless task. And the main reasons that this case was picked up- it was on sale for $50 off. This case is a little like Cadillac comparing to other Hondas.",
      "Very spacious PC case that gives you a ton of room to work with. Would highly recommend to anybody considering NZXT cases.",
      "For a first-time build, I have nothing bad to say about this case. It looks amazing; the tempered glass panels looks as if you can reach right through it, and this is after I've taken the side panel on and off several times now post-plastic-removal and have smudged it with a few fingerprints already.\nThe multitude of cable management options were a lifesaver. You get velcro straps pre-installed, a plastic laneway for the thicker ones and numerous zip-tie/twist-tie mounts built into the chassis.\nAirflow seems good. Perhaps the top vent could be more open, but I have no issues with cooling so far. I purchased an additional 3-pack of same-brand fans on the bottom to provide intake along with the stock side panel fans, and a same-brand AIO on the top for exhaust with the back panel fan. With this setup, the case has very good positive pressure to assist in dust-proofing.",

      "The friendliest case I've ever built inside, love where the PSU sits, how easily it comes apart, design makes cable management extremely easy",
      "This thing is an absolute beauty, although VERY large. It also ways like a ton. Nonetheless, this case gave me plenty of space in the back which was helpful for building my first pc as I wasn't really sure how to cable manage so I kind of just stuck everything back there. It came with 3 F120 Duo Fans which was helpful because I wanted a full F120 Duo build. I also really love the floating affect that the top fan bracket has.",
      "One of the best looking cases, for sure. So easy to work with. And it stays cool.",
      "So much room to build in, and stays very cool. It is designed for easy cable management.",
      "Joy to build in for a first-timer. So much room. Back chamber is great. Love the elevated PSU platform. If you don't specifically want the window on the top, get the H9 Flow. But if you can make use of it with cool looking fans, the Elite is awesome."

      "Pretty unique case since it's moved the PSU up to the front. Means that smaller PSUs with less bulky cables are very preferable when building in this case. Overall with the PSU I got, cable management was tolerable. Comes with 2 standard 120mm bottom mounted fans and 2 140mm RGB fans in the front, but is missing a rear exhaust fan. A rear exhaust fan isn't necessary, especially since this case already has excellent thermals, but it did knock a few degrees off my CPU temp under load so it's probably best to buy one.\nOne of the cable management brackets did block the USB header from plugging in as my motherboard had a sideways connector, so I had to unscrew it and remove it. Cable routing is weird for the 24 pin but otherwise everything is as expected. There's a small hole next to the bottom mounted fans for routing graphics card cables which is very convenient. Included anti-sag bracket is very easy to adjust and doesn't stand out. Panels are very easy to remove and don't feel cheap despite the case's price.\nFans are very loud at max speed, but running them at just 20% speed is enough most of the time. Thermals are excellent for both CPU and GPU. GPU cooling is especially good as the power supply being moved to the front mean the two fans blowing air directly at the GPU are basically unobstructed.",
      "Aesthetically, it's a beautiful case. White fans, white cables, chrome thumb screws, basically nothing looks cheap. Building in it is extremely nice. All panels are toolless, although I wish the small side panel could be removed without taking the glass panel off first. The GPU sag bracket and velcro cable ties were small but greatly appreciated features.\nA few areas were a little cramped, namely the PSU power extension cable (which required some tight bending to flip and match the PSU orientation) and the connector ports on the other side. I can excuse that for the sake of the PSU placement and the airflow it opens up, but the lack of mesh at the bottom rear of the case does bother me since it almost defeats the purpose of mesh on the other sides.\nThe biggest issue I had with this were the case fans. Running at the silent setting for my motherboard (30% for front and bottom) both sets of fans had a quiet but clear resonance. Putting the front at 31% and the bottom at 34% fixed this, but either way the idle noise is a little higher than I would've liked.",
      "Excellent airflow, looks great, isn't huge. Checked all my boxes.",

      "Love the style!",
      "pretty & functional. Some sharp edges inside.",
      "It's a great size not too small, not massive, though the GPU only just fit in with the case fans in, probably a half-inch grab between the 2. Cable management isn't bad but it isn't perfect. I would have liked a better HDD bay position. Thick PSU cables are blocked by the HDD bay/rack. I'm not using any 3.5\" drives, so it’s not a dealbreaker, just annoying. Not sure if I blame the case or the PSU for the tight space.",
      "Good overall case, honestly I should’ve gotten a black version of this but hey, too late. The back of the case is very spacious and was able to do some cable management to some extent. Got rid of the fans it came with to some cooler master halo fans, 3pack for like $40 if I recall correctly. The power button on the front panel lights up and feels quite premium and not some cheap plastic feeling.",

      "Nice case being white, lots of places where to pass the wires, it would be nice if it were a little bit taller",
      "cheap but not bad, feel premium",
      "Was always my dream to have this case with my new build. It comes with 2 pre-installed non-rgb fans, which I later then moved them to the top (bc I bought a 3 pack sp120 elite rgb fans and put them at the front). Very happy with this purchase because I bought a combo of this case with the corsair rm850 white, in newegg for $149.",
      "Amazing case had it since 2020 and has held up well with good airflow. Planning to upgrade though since i am bored of it",

      "Fantastic case. Well designed and thought out. Everything has its place and fits well. The AIO plate slides out to make plugging stuff in much easier. There's lots of adapter plates and lots of screws of all shapes and sizes to make all sorts of configurations work. The removable GPU slot is a lifesaver.\nThe case is made of thick sturdy steel. My cat shoved the glass sheet off my desk onto hardwood floor with a bit of force and it didn't break.\nAirflow is pretty good and the mesh keeps most dust out, but could be better to account for dustier floors. Mine sits on my desk so I'm not too bothered.\nThe website pics show you can use an ATX PSU, but there is no way that the cables coming out of it would have fit in my build if it wasn't SFX - my GPU is 320mm long and ends about half way past the PSU. Maybe an ATX would fit if the intake fan on the back was a 90mm and the AIO could be pushed all the way up against the back of the case - then the PSU can be mounted on the highest position if using an AIO. With a 120mm sitting there, the water hoses don't clear.\nI put my SATA on the HDD slot because the designated SATA slot would then be directly in front of the PSU hot air exhaust.\nFor the bottom fans I recommend 120mm and not 140mm because then you'll have to bend some of the MoBo USB header cables and such a bit too hard to make them fit imo.\nAll in all I'm super impressed my how much this case can fit, how well it all sits in it, and how well it's built. It was a fun time finessing all the parts in and getting the cabling to be perfectly organized.",
      "Sturdy with excellent build quality Cable managemnt a breeze with SFX PSU. Does get cramped with ATX PSU. Was thinking of going with a RMe psu from corsair but glad I chose a SFX one. Top handle can be tricky to fasten properly (and can pop off if not correctly attached and secured)",
      "It will be perfect after 2-3 updates. Jonsbo D32 has solved some of issues and the others will come.",
      "Can fit a 323mm GPU. Fit a ATX PSU no problems.",
      "Compact, portable, while not sacrificing airflow and still having flexibility on what components can be used. Great if you want to get into smaller form factors. Right in that sweet spot of ITX and MATX, where you get the best of both worlds.",
      "Well organized case, with more room than expected to work with. Wish there was a way to install the PSU vertically without interfering with the water cooling or the GPU, and wish it was easier to cable manage in. Additionally, a corner came with a dent in it (over-tightening the screw, perhaps?) but otherwise a solid mATX option!",
      "A pretty amazing and high-quality case with a lot of good features. The only caveat is the...interesting...airflow configuration, since the front of the case has no room for fans, and the PSU takes up half of the space. I recommend two intakes on the top, one exhaust at the back, and optionally two intake/exhaust at the bottom, depending on how your GPU fans work. You could also do an AIO exhausting out the top, and make the rear fan an intake. Other than that, it's quite the looker, with a handy (removable) carry handle to boot!"

      "Nice case. Heavy. Only complaint is the the front panel comes off pretty easily. I get scared that if I hold it wrong, the front panel would come off and I'd drop the whole computer.",
      "This thing rocks! Cooling is pretty well optimized with a 280mm radiator up top and two 120mm fans as intake through the bottom (it IS possible). The use of one single screw type throughout the case makes building so much easier, and the tool-less panels have a very secure fit. You'll want to use an SFX power supply over an SFX-L for the extra cable management space. And the option of glass or vented side panel is a fantastic inclusion."

      "Great case. Comes with 3 fans (pretty quiet ngl). Bought it simply because it was cheap (and for the fans).",
      "Super spacious and the included fans are bonus. Only things of note, While building, a rivet fell out. I eventually found where it was supposed to go. It didn't seem to compromise the integrity or rigidity of the case after flexing multiple metal plates. Very roomy when it came to cable management and routing. The location of the USB-C port on the MSI Pro B650-S is right between the two rubber grommets so you'll have to choose between the two. Took out the HDD/SSD box in the bottom of the case to save on weight and for extra room for cable management. There is still 2 SSD slots in the back of the case to I'm not too worried about upgrading in the future. Not sure if this is the CPU cooler or case fans but while stress testing, the fans whine a little bit. My guess is some plastic include the blades are hitting the side of the housing. Again, not sure if this is the cooler or not so no harm, no foul.",
      "Montech, I know you made great value cases and I really like the look of this one. However, I spent 2-3 hours trying to screw the bottom case fans and just couldn’t do it as the holes for them are too small for the fan screws. Eventually, I just gave up. I recommended there needs to be more slots for cable management at the back too.",
      "This case is huge and I love it: It has great cable management options inside. I only dock it a point because the holes in the front mesh are a little big if you have pets and want to keep animal hair & dander out.",
      "For those looking for non RBG cases with good airflow and preinstalled fans, this case is perfect! Airflow is great and 3 preinstalled (2 intake, 1 back exhaust) 140mm fans are a massive upside!",
      "Nice big box with quiet fans, all PWMs. Bargain price. It would be better if the glass had hinges.",
      "Great airflow and plenty of space.",
      "For the money it's a steal!",
      "For $65, this is amazing case. It has everything you'd want for an amazing price, and it comes with three fans. Fans are not Noctua quite but they are still plenty silent in my opinion. It is a little larger than your standard ATX case since it is made to also fit E-ATX, but that means easy upgradeability in the future if you desire.",
      "Glass side panel, good cable management, comes with 3 QUIET fans, and 3 velcro cable ties that channel everything together nicely. Awesome cable management."

      "I like it because it’s a Lian Li :D (Definitely some Brand Bias)\nIt’s definitely not what I expected from Lian Li in terms of aluminum build quality. That said, don’t get me wrong—it's still extremely well built. I think they chose thinner aluminum to make the case lighter. Despite that, the case is surprisingly rigid, especially compared to other smaller form factor cases. It can even fit a 240mm AIO with some obvious clearance restrictions. My only gripe is the lack of cable management; it feels more like a suggestion than a practical feature, making it difficult to route cables cleanly.",
      "Love this case. It looks sleek and is actually quite easy to build in (granted you need to do some research and check fittings). Definitely try to build this is one go. It’s a pain to have to take things apart when upgrading components.",
      "Cable management can be a little tricky...but the flexibility with CPU coolers and 3 slot GPUs is untouchable.",
      "SFFPC is really great to save space while retaining 99% functionality of a full tower case. Thermals was slightly higher but that's reasonable for something so dense yet powerful. Easier than expected to work in. Use custom cables to save time on cable management.",
      "Great itx case if you want to buy from amazon and it is also about the same size as the formd t1.",
      "I give this 3 out of 5 for not specifying what fits. It says SFX-L works - it really does not. Maybe with custom cables. Also, they need a better list of out of the box coolers. If you want out of the box without breaking the bank (and not sanctioned by the US government), then you are probably looking at a more expensive option that actually fits this case.\nIt's an all right case. It's ITX and expensive. I would do another build in one knowing what I know now so long as I am good with AIO cooling.\nI would recommend SFX only power supply, moderate parts that do not go over the need for a 750W power supply (maybe 850W if you find that in SFX), and being really careful on the 240 AIO fit.\nMy issue, but I lost a screw during assembly and can't find the right replacement. Support does not seem to have a list of the actual screw types in the build. I found one, but that is also an easy fix for Lian Li.",
      "Great case and was relatively easy to build in, but a bit expensive. Used this for my first ITX build but I am an experienced PC builder with over a decade of ATX builds under my belt. I would still recommend this case for new builders provided they do a little bit of extra research and watch a few Youtube videos. The case is super clean and unbelievably compact, I fit a 3090 FE in there! It can even accommodate 240mm AIOs in the top. It supports SFX-L power supplies but I don't recommend you go larger than standard SFX PSU. I also recommend some custom length cables as space for cable management is limited.\nThings to keep in mind: depending on your motherboard layout the PSU is right up against where SATA connectors usually go which matters if you intend to take advantage of the 2.5in SSD mount supported on the bottom of the case. Also there are no dust filters included, and the case feet are very short this may be a concern to those with pets or dusty environments.",
      "A minimalistic and high quality SFF case that is easy to build in with the right parts.\nGPU and power supply temperatures are fantastic, but the CPU temperatures can suffer a bit when the AIO is drawing in hot air from the GPU. It's a great case for a lower TDP CPU such as a 7800X3D instead of a 14900K.\nBuild quality is good, it has a nice paint finish and smooth but precise edges. Everything fit together well with no issues with part tolerances.\nCompatibility is reasonably good: - It fits a wide range of 240mm AIO coolers, but you do need to make sure the pump isn't too high and the hoses aren't too long. - SFX and SFX-L power supplies are supported, but SFX-L made the build process more difficult for me. - Large GPUs such as certain RTX 4080/4090 models can fit without an issue, as long as you do your research. - Custom PSU cables would be recommended to make the build process easier, but it's still possible with the stock cables.\nThe case is on the expensive side, but if you can find it on sale or just love the design of it, I'd recommend it.",
      "My first SFF case, and what an adventure! It's wild I can shove a rig that races past my first build into a case almost 1/8th the capacity. It fits my requirements of fitting into my backpack as well for travel. It's also simple and aesthetically pleasing.\nSo why am I knocking off a star? A few reasons. First, cable managing inside was a nightmare. I almost wished I'd waited to build in the NR200P Max after moving to my final destination and ordering locally. I had enough trouble as it was trying to build without an AIO's piping to manage, and I feel like my build time would have added at least another hour or two had I used an AIO.\nI also really do not like the fact that this case comes with no dust filters. I know sacrifices had to be made in a case this small, but I prefer at least having the option for it. May look into some custom panels later with different holes/perforation. The PCIE riser cable's locking mechanism for the GPU is also very flimsy and I knocked it off by accident today while trying to take the 4090 out.\nBesides that, it's a good case, and I marvel at the fact that I can fit a 4090 FE into a box this small.",
      "First SFF PC build, pretty easy to build in once you've built in it. 2/3 of my zip ties were thrown away after cables needed to be rerouted or recoaxed. The only place to \"cable manage\" is under the PSU, so use the space between the PSU cage and the power cables wisely.\nThe riser cable is too long, but it doesn't pose any problems. Had I known it would create a little tunnel, I might have considered using it to hide some excess cabling.\nThe panel fitment is the only weak part. My top panel doesn't close flush to the side panels, and I don't think it's caused by my radiator mounting screws as the top full snaps closed effortlessly.\nTake your time and you'll have a solid computer and a statement piece for work or entertainment."

      "This tower is easy to build in and looks fantastic.",
      "Really nice, clean looking case. Very easy to build in, has 3 nice ARGB fans at the front, and 1 non RGB fan at the rear. Included fans are pretty quiet. It also has clearance for bigger air coolers too, which is great. Comes with great tools for cable management too.\nSome bad things... - The PSU positioning is weird, but it works. - No 360mm AIO support on top, only at the front. - GPU fan was removed. - Top panel I/O is a little light.\nIf you can push these things to the side, it's a solid 9/10 case."

      "One of the best cases I've worked with.",

      "I absolutely love this case plenty of Cable room for management, came with GPU riser for vertical mounting which is the only option in this case. My GPU is a 3 slot card it has about 3mm of space between it and the glass, I haven't had any cooling issues but for larger GPU's would recommend getting the y70 I prefer the one without the screen but whatever floats your boat it fits larger cards much better.",
      "The Hyte Y60 glass-encased case paired with a separate 515x1920 display on the front panel is a showstopper that elicits awe from all onlookers, transcending gender barriers. This combo is a true panty-dropper in the world of PC aesthetics!",
      "I love the look of the case and it was really easy to build in. There's plenty of room for cable management and incredible airflow. My only gripe is the tabs on the side panels that basically kneecap the thumbscrews and make only really work with a screwdriver.",
      "Excellent case. Well designed. Easy to build in.",
      "Really nice case, but beware that it isn't great for air cooled GPUs. In hindsight I probably would have picked a different case",
      "Pretty pricey but one of the best looking cases on the market.",
      "So much fund to build in. As long as you get one of the thinner 40 series cards GPU will fit just fine. Temps are great as long as you have enough airflow!"

      "I never had intent on my build being a showcase. I never owned a glass panel case and didn't intend to but the price on this was too good to pass up. The right size for my needs. Pros: It just works. The front looks great and shows the RGB well. It is quiet. Great size, 2 USB 3.0 ports. Comes with fans. TWO front 5.25 slots!! Good placement for SSD 2.5 drives. Fits 120mm and 140mm fan sizes. Good air flow. Top magnetic mesh keeps dust out. Cons: It's not the lightest. USB-C port has to be purchased separately. Could use more openings for cable management.\nOverall, happy with this case, and would recommend.",
      "Very nice!",
      "Good case, easy to build in.",
      "Great quality and airflow. Modern looks paired with Fractal's quality and cooling capacity is a match made in heaven in this price point.",
      "Great looking case from Fractal. Great price point, it's awesome that it still supports 5 1/4\" drives, and the storage tray is severely underrated. Included fans aren't 4 pin PWM, but at this price point, they are still great and the RGB looks awesome. The included RGB button on the top is great, and the Northern Lights setting looks great. Magnetic dust filter on the top is pretty good too. The only thing is that there's not too much room for cable routing/ management in the back, but once again, it's very good for the price.",
      "Rgb fans work fine, a little loud but it does its job and looks cool. Wire management was easy with this, it comes with Velcro straps.",
      "(My actual rating is a 3.5 stars) The case is built really nicely, the reason I don't like is because the front panel takes up so much space and is preventing the case from having a 360mm Aio mounting point up top, I originally bought a 360mm Aio thinking it would fit but it didn't so I returned it and got a air cooler. instead maybe next time put it horizontally, other than that it was a good case RGB was nice and the fans were good.",
      "Built in cable management is amazing, Enough space for everything, Built in fans are amazing, Compartments are spacious and helpful.",
      "I think its quite nice the downsides are that you have to add usbc with an extra cable, the fans being dc only, and the fan cables being short.",
      "This case is amazing!!! It was so nice to build in. The built in cable management is nice, the fans are relatively to hook up, the PCIE covers were easy to take off, everything is good in this case. Plus, it looks stunning.\nThe RGB is really good as well.\nAlso, the inclusion of two 5.2\" drive bays is nice but a USB-C port should be included though."

      "Manual was a nightmare to use with poor descriptions of things.\nTop exhaust fans advertised as 3 x 120 mm fans or 2 x 140 mm fans capacity. I chose to do 2 x 120 with pressure leak plate installed. Definitely created a pressure leak as you can see gaps between the fans and even the leak plate. 2 x 140 mm fans would have fit perfectly with no pressure leaks, and I may actually swap for these in the future.\nI'm going to buy extra DIY magnetic dust filters for the top and side panel.\nI chose this case overall for it's minimalistic look and good thermals.",
      "Beautiful case, never heard of this brand but I researched them and they seem to be highly rated. Case was lovely to build in with lots of room. I wanted minimal RGB and this delivered.\nNo fan hub on the non-RGB version I got, and with my MB having 3 SYS Fan headers, I ended up having to buy a PWM Y Fan Splitter to daisy chain the front intakes but that was only a few pound.\nVery happy with this case. Great price too for the premium feel/look you get from it.",
      "Cheap, clean/simple look, good stock fans and plenty of space for a thick and long rad at the top. Ticks a lot of boxes.",
      "The Lian Li 216 was an absolute delight to build in. The air flow is remarkable.",
      "This is the best case I've ever used. This case has crazy amount of air flow and it's really easy to work with. Cable management room is perfect. The quality of the Lian Li Lancool 216 is 10/10. I used the included GPU support Bracket (Lian LI GB 001) and it worked out really well. This case is a big example that shows us how much Lian Li cares about quality and detail.",
      "Chose this case explicitly for the rotatable pci-e plates and the rear pci-e fan brackets. Other solutions require gaps that look really ugly.\nWhen mounting gpu vertically, please use the longer stands in the plastic box. The threading is different than the stands that come with the gpu backet in the other bag",
      "This was my first PC build in several years and cases sure have come a long way since then. This case was easy to work in with plenty of space. I love being able to take off both sides or top as needed. The magnet attachments work well for me and feel solid. The fans are quiet and keep everything cool. Plenty of room for my 7900xt and modular PSU. Cable management is handled nicely with plenty of options on the non-viewing side. The cables on two of the case fans were a bit short and I needed to buy some inexpensive cable extensions for these in order to keep my cable management in check.",
      "The removable top for aio mounting saved so much time. Build quality and accessories do not disappoint. This is the best case of 2023."

      "Just built in this case. It looks good, came with 5 preinstalled fans connected to a fan hub and all the accessories you would need for a fairly standard install. Good cable management spaces and tie down velcro straps. Quick release pins on the sides, top and front panel (1 captive thumbscrew to secure the sides for transport). Removable frame on the top to attach an AIO/fans to. Only negative was no rubber mounts for HDD's (not exactly a deal breaker), and the basement was a bit tight when installing the PSU. Can definitely recommend this case if you want a standard good airflow case with some subtle wood accents.",

      "Excellent all-rounder case. I really do like how the front panel looks. It's by no means the best in any category, but after replacing my Lancool 207 with this, it has zero faults.",
      "I'm very happy with this case. It's gorgeous, and there's so much room inside. There are also lots of clips, and holes, that make cable management a breeze. Right out of the package, cables are organized as well, which makes things very simple. The only complaint I have is getting the cables into the PSU was frustrating. I could have done this easier if I planned better, but lesson learned! Not docking a star because it was my own fault.",
      "My brother chose the Antec FLUX in Black with Walnut trim for his build, and he chose well. This case is a pleasure to build in, with well-placed cable channels and routing grommets, as well as velcro cinches for cable management . The 5 pre-installed fans move a lot of air, though they are non-RGB. The only complaint I have is a nitpick, but it did cause an issue: when the PSU is installed, the rear cable routing grommet becomes unusable, which made it a bit more difficult to route the HD Audio, chassis fan and USB headers."

      "A really cool case. My partner really liked the low-key LED stripe up the center, and I liked that the fans came preinstalled. I also like that some of the cable management was already done for me. It's a little fussy to get the panels on and off, and plugging in the CPU cord between the preinstalled fans was a real challenge, but it was all worth it. It fit my chonker GPU just fine, and the motherboard screwed in perfectly. So far it's living up to its name as a quiet bunch of fans in a case."

      "the versa h17 was out of stock so i got this instead, really nice to build in for the price! 😊",
      "Given that I paid $40 for this case, it's amazing! Not perfect, but 5 stars given its budget category. My main complaint is installing the fans uses the random holes in the panels: it's really hard to tell which holes you're \"supposed\" to use. Though maybe that was intentional, because I totally had to take advantage of that to install the top fan (back position collided with the motherboard, front position collided with something else, middle pseudo-position worked just fine). The build quality feels a little flimsy, but it is a light case. Panel filters' magnets are a bit weak. PCIe covers are disposable which feels weird (but maybe that's normal nowadays).",
      "Mixed feelings about this case. It was one of very few options for a mini tower that didn't look like it came from a low budget sci-fi film, was reasonably priced and had somewhat decent ventilation and room for a GPU. Coming from a 20eur case, this one at 65eur does feel a bit overpriced for what it is though.\nThe grill pattern is such that you can place 120mm fans/rad at any place within the panel. There are 'dedicated' spots for them too, but that placement can interfere with cables or such, so it's nice that I could move them off-center to make it work. At the same time the pattern is a bit coarse for optimal ventilation it seems.\nComes with only one 120mm fan. In my case I bought a 5-pack of fans in addition, not that that made the whole thing any more cost effective."

      "I love this case. It's big without being obscene, sturdy, and it doesn't look like a fishtank. It's extremely modular, cable management is a breeze, and the drive racks are removable and reconfigurable. The fan mounts on the top and side have sound-dampening plates so you can cover what you don't need. The front door is reversible, and is held in place with magnets, so you can swap it to either side, or just take the hinges off and just pop it in place. I did have to \"modify\" one of the drive racks to get my graphics card to fit, as it was about 2mm too long, but that didn't prevent the drive mounts from locking into place, and I don't think it would be visible, even if I didn't have the sides on.",
      "Pretty efficient design, nice soundproofing and filtering features. Cables are well organized with included velcro straps, though there are two mystery cables without labels that I have no idea where they are meant to go.\nThe fans are the old 3 pin version with no speed control, which is kind of janky. I swapped in a couple better Noctua fans.\nI also kind of wish I got a newer design that had USB-C in front panel, but options are limited because I still need a DVD drive for occasionally ripping CDs.",
      "A bit pricey, but it's very practical. Plenty of internal space and internal bays, 2 5.25\" front bays, and 4 front USB ports. It also includes an air filter, which helps if it's in a dusty environment. The front door covering the front bays also keeps the design sleek and the side it hinges on can be changed. The inclusion of a reset button won't be commonly used, but I appreciate it's presence in case of a system hang or if I'm doing testing and want to quickly restart.",
      "Not the best i ever had, but ok-ish.\nAdvantages : - cable management - each panels and parts have sort of fabric to make sound quiet and it works pretty well - Dust filter on each admission fan slot\nDrawbacks: - its side panel can close so it needs to tap over it to put it in place - It's black, so it's a terrible pain when you need to find screws !",
      "A fantastic case. There's more drive bays than I know what to do with and it keeps everything wonderfully quiet. Lots of features.",
      "Been left behind a little by more modern designs but it's still an extremely solid, quiet, well featured case.",
      "I was after a sensible case which had plenty of space inside for drives, was going to be silent and would keep cool. It also had to have at least one optical drive bay so I could have a DVD reader for ripping CD's to MP3 format. Plus I wanted 4 case top mounted USB sockets. This case got great reviews but it was an old version of the Fractal Design more recent cases, e.g. R6 or R7. however, it looked the part and met my criteria. And it was still available. I'm pleased I chose this case as it satisfied my requirements plus the cable management was a breeze. Pricing was bouncing between £120 and £240 depending where the stock was so it was a case of keeping an eye on PC Parkpicker and getting in at the lower price. I took out the small 3 tray drive case and spaced my two HDD to the top and bottom of the 5 tray drive case to allow for maximum air flow through the case. Seems to be working well.",
      "Quoth Ron Swanson: \"This is an excellent rectangle.\" It's an older model and not the cheapest, but has all the quality of life features I wanted for a clean, easy build.\nI did consider the newer Define 7 and Define 7 XL, as those can hold more 3.5\" drives; however, they require purchase of extra hard drive trays (apparently a bit hard to find right now) for even more money. Given that I am nowhere near filling the storage in this build, and I could still double the usable storage in the same case, the older model seemed like a better choice to me... but do give the new options a look and decide for yourself.\nFinally, it's worth noting this is not an airflow-optimized case, so it's not really a good choice for a gaming rig or workstation with high-power components. It is, though, good at dampening the sound of some hard drives.",
      "Love this case, used it to transfer my Plex server into. I have only 4 drives in it, but there's plenty of extra space for more cables when I add more drives.\nMy only real complaint is the passthrough cutout in the top left section of the motherboard tray is too small. My CPU cable was too big to fit through without removing the grommet, passing through the cable, then reinserting the grommet (NOT easy to do).",
      "Absolutely fantastic case. By far the best case I have ever owned.\nThis was a very nice case to work in. The build quality is excellent, being very heavy and solid. It has plenty of room for expansion and cable management. I love the minimal-yet-functional design and the severe lack of RGB nonsense. It not only has eight 3.5\" bays (perfect for my home server build), but it also has two 5.25\" bays for those of us who still swear by optical media.\nPlease, Fractal, never discontinue this case. I want to replace my Phanteks Enthoo Pro M with another one of these in the near-ish future."

      "Cable management is a bit annoying but everything else is fine.",
      "This case is massive and heavy. I think it offers a really unique design and has plenty of space to work inside. You could put anything in this case and it would fit (with the exception of an optical drive). Because of it's size, you need CPU power connector extensions. The ones that come with the case barely worked in my case. Other PSU's will likely need extensions longer than the 9\" ones that come with the case. This is not the coldest case on the market, but I've had no thermal issues when I pair it with 7 Lian Li uni SL v2's.",
      "I love this case! The glass front panel with the RGB ROG eye logo is so frikkin cool lol. And I love that you can use Aura Sync to sync the RGB lighting with all the rest of your RGB things. This case has PLENTY of room to work in. It fits an EATX mobo and giant cards like a 4090 with no problem. In fact, I have a EATX mobo and 4090 in this case WITH a 360mm AIO cooler with both push and pull fans installed on it, and there is still plenty of space. You can fit a 420mm AIO cooler rad in front which I didn't even know was a thing until I saw this case lol. Seems like there is great airflow in the case because I've been running at great temps so far. Also, it comes with straps on the top of it to help with lifting it. As you can imagine, this case is SUPER heavy even on its own. With the 4090 and everything else in it, this build in general has to be about 50 lbs lol. Very much not a portable PC by any means.\nMy only real gripe is the \"caution: tempered glass\" sticker on the side panel that you can't really peel off without a lot of residue being left behind. Also, it was surprisingly a bit tougher to buld in than I thought it would be. I had to remove the 3.5\" drive bays and the adjustable holder thing to have space for everything I wanted to do. Not the end of the world, but surprising for such a big case.",
      "<3 full towers & Fans\nOnly thing I'd add. CPU/MoBo(behind) side panel fan.\nBeast of a Tower",
      "Beast of a case, the straps are a major plus to assist in carrying around...but will probably never leave its permanent home on my desk.",
      "Needs Better airflow. Has bottom filter but no fan slots. Looks cool, relatively easy to build in.",
      "This case is a beast. Super heavy empty, let a lone with a full system inside it. Side panel glass is extremely nice. Was spacious and easy to build in. Has plenty of Cable Management tie downs in the back of the case. The bottom PSU/HDD shrouds didn't fit back in the case with how my setup is. Got pretty tight with the front panel IO cables plugged in and the AIO tubing mounted to the front. Airflow is a bit lack luster as you have to brute force air intake from the front. Only open at the top and bottom otherwise it's a solid sheet of glass. Has a lot of option for customizability. On the back side there is a black plastic door to help hide and cover cable management. While I didn't do an amazing job with my cables I was unable to close the door and screw it in so I had to leave it out of the build.",
      "Amazing for cable management and space. Easy installation. And just gorgeous. But you need adaptors if your motherboard doesn’t have sufficient headers.",
      "Absolutely LOVE this case! First time builder but I don’t regret the purchase price of $300 USD or the weight of it all. It has everything a beginner and advanced builder would ever need. Had absolutely no problems with cable management, space for components, ease of access for the MOBO, or connectivity. Definitely would buy again.",
      "not that I have much experience with other cases but I found this case to be pretty good. Lots of room, very intuitive design very good cable management. I have seen another more professional reviews on line with airflow and temperature testing data and this case does have restricted airflow through front fans due to that RGB glass panel and removing it helps but for my needs I think it should be just fine.\n1-11-20 I have noticed after having to removed stuff and reinstall stuff that the part in the case that's used to give additional support for the GPU. you need to mess with it a bit to make it work without looking tweaked. you can't just slide it to the spots it has labeled as it may looked bowed and it's not necessary as it doesn't have to be fully slid one way or another to cover the wiring. I also found it necessary to remove one of the metal rods that holds the supports in favor of using two supports on one rod. You also need to be careful on how you use that support on your GPU, I didn't realize at first but the support was jamming one of the fans on my GPU and i had to adjust it."
